<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>INTRODUCTORY
ESSAY.</h2>
<p>We have again to present to our friends the Report of the Annual
Mortality in the Society of Friends, in Great Britain and Ireland.&nbsp;
It has frequently been observed, how nearly the number of deaths in
each year has approximated, but we have this year to notice a considerable
diminution in the annual return.&nbsp; We are not disposed, however,
to attribute the diminished numbers, chiefly to any special cause connected
with health, but consider it rather as one of those fluctuations which
are ever found to arise in a series of years, in the mortality of a
small community.&nbsp; The number of the dying, however, may be expected
to bear, as respects the average, a pretty uniform relation to the number
of the living.&nbsp; And if the fact be, as all our late inquiries lead
us to believe it is, that we are, though slowly, a diminishing body,
we must expect that our average number of deaths will also be found
gradually to diminish.</p>
<p><!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>We
have often anxiously pondered over the question,&mdash;Why the Society
of Friends should be a diminishing body?&nbsp; And we propose to give
in this place a few of the thoughts which have been suggested to us
in the course of our consideration.</p>
<p>In the first place, let us notice the natural causes which tend to
the decrease of our Society.&nbsp; We have formerly shown that the mortality
among our members is less than in the community at large, which so far
as it extends, is of course a reason for the increase rather than the
diminution of our numbers.&nbsp; But then we have, on the other side,
the well-ascertained fact, that whilst in the community at large, the
registered births exceed the deaths, by 45 per cent; in the Society
of Friends, the registered deaths actually exceed the births!&nbsp;
The cause of this fact is to be found, not only in connection with the
number who marry out of the Society, but also in the operation of that
prudential check on entering into the married state, which will always
prevail amongst a moral people, where the means of subsistence cannot
easily and with certainty be obtained.&nbsp; But to whatever we may
attribute the cause, the fact itself is a complete answer to the question&mdash;Why
<!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>we
are a diminishing rather than an increasing people?</p>
<p>It may be said,&mdash;Why are not our religious principles aggressive?&mdash;Why,
if they be true, do they not find converts among the various Christian
communities of our land?&mdash;Why, as in the early times of our Society,
are there not numerous conversions, and fresh bodies of warm-hearted,
and sound-minded believers, added to our numbers?&mdash;These are deeply
important and very interesting questions, and we are willing to offer
a few thoughts upon them, with the seriousness and modesty with which
it becomes us to speak on the subject.</p>
<p>We believe, that a mistaken view prevails, in regard to the truest
Christian principle being that which will be accepted by the largest
number of persons.&nbsp; The experience of all the past ages of the
Church contradicts the assumption, and shows clearly that there is in
man a deep-seated opposition to the acceptance of divine truth in its
purity and simplicity.&nbsp; True vital religion has ever called for
the service of man&rsquo;s heart to God, and in every age, this allegiance
has been the state of the <i>few</i>, rather than of the <i>many</i>.&nbsp;
The history of the <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>ancient
church is full of illustrations of this truth.&nbsp; Whilst Moses lingered
on the Mount, whence the children of Israel knew that the law was to
be given, and from whence such evident demonstrations of the divine
power had been manifest to the people, they were employed in making
the golden calf to go before them, and crying &ldquo;these are thy Gods,
O Israel!&rdquo;&nbsp; And when they had received the law, written by
the finger of God, and were somewhat humbled under the correction of
their sins, how few were there, who carried out its injunctions in their
genuine spirit, and how many were there, who from time to time, defiled
themselves by the idolatrous service of other gods.&nbsp; Even when
brought by a strong hand, and an outstretched arm, attended by many
palpable miracles which were wrought on their behalf, they were seated
in the &ldquo;Land flowing with milk and honey,&rdquo; which had been
promised to their fathers; how prone were they constantly to desert
even the profession of their faith, and to serve the gods of the nations
which they were sent to destroy; yet in all these times there were a
few, and it was probably comparatively but a <i>few</i>, who had not
bowed the knee to Baal.</p>
<p><!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>We
have evidence of the same fact in the history of Christianity.&nbsp;
The beautiful example of the Saviour, and the wonderful miracles which
he performed&mdash;all for the good of man&mdash;failed to attract the
high boasted reason of the Greek, or the Roman, or to soften the obduracy
of the blind and hard Pharisaic hearted Jew: it was still the <i>few</i>
who had sympathy with the character He exhibited, and the truths which
He spoke, and who found Him to be to their souls &ldquo;the power of
God unto salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; And even when these few were gathered
together, and under the extraordinary effusion of the Holy Spirit, many
were added to them, and &ldquo;the multitude of them that believed were
of one heart and one soul,&rdquo; they were still comparatively but
a <i>few</i>.</p>
<p>The further history of the Christian Church may appear to some to
exhibit a different view, but to us it seems not less clearly to illustrate
the same melancholy truth.</p>
<p>It is certain, that during the life-time of the Apostles, many by
their powerful preaching, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, were
brought to repentance and a living faith in Christ, and we know that
not a few sealed their testimony with <!-- page viii--><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>their
blood, yet the simplicity and the purity of Christianity were soon more
or less spoiled by the still contracted spirit and notions of many of
the Jews, or the false philosophy, not entirely abandoned, of the pagan
converts.&nbsp; We doubt not, however, that notwithstanding these deteriorating
admixtures, there may be said to have been many&mdash;aye, a glorious
multitude&mdash;who held the truth in its primitive power, and in a
large measure of primitive simplicity.&nbsp; Still, when these are compared
with the whole population of the countries where the Truth was preached,
the real converts must be spoken of as a <i>few</i>, and thus was it
evident that there was still an inherent opposition in man to the restraining
and purifying doctrines of the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>And when in later years, whole nations and peoples were said to become
Christians, it may well be doubted whether in such times there had not
been as great a reduction of the number of true converts of old standing,
as there was addition of this class amongst the new ones.&nbsp; Christianity
as professed in those days, had thrown off her simple garb, and had
decorated herself to please the corrupt taste of <!-- page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>the
people&mdash;as the sun and other heavenly bodies were probably the
earliest objects of adoration to mankind, and were used in the first
instance as striking symbols of the light and power of the one Creator
and Father, so did the professors of Christianity, pretty early present
to the people, some intermediate objects of reverence and love, by which
those who turned from the simple affiance to the one Great Redeemer
and High Priest, might find a rest suited to their carnal, or at least
imperfectly spiritual conception of Christianity.&nbsp; And when the
temporal church boasted of its universal sway in Europe, and its entire
unity, there were probably a smaller number of true Christians within
its pale, than existed in the midst of pagan persecutions at the close
of the apostolic age.</p>
<p>Let us now look at times nearer to our own, when Huss, and Luther,
and Zwingle, by a power not their own, caused many rays of the glorious
light of Truth to shine upon benighted nations, and disturbed the slumbers
of the corrupted church.&nbsp; Great were, and still are the blessings
derived from the great struggle.&nbsp; Many of the bonds of Satan were
broken, and many a heavy burdened soul found its long desired rest.&nbsp;
Yet how soon <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>was
even the brightness of this morning dimmed, and how little progress
did the cause of the Reformation make after the departure of the immediate
instruments in the great movement.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, not inaptly called the cradle of the English Reformation,
the Cantons which, in the first instance received the truth and joined
the Protestant cause, continue still to bear the same name, but not
one which at that time retained the designation of Catholic, has since
become Protestant: and at Geneva, where Calvin taught, and where his
doctrines are still professed, opinions which were not less abhorrent
to him than the worst of the errors of popery, are openly maintained.&nbsp;
Those who now preach the vital truths of the Reformation, are the <i>few</i>
not the <i>many</i>.</p>
<p>In England, the iron rule of Elizabeth in ecclesiastical matters,
and in particular her requirement of uniformity with respect to the
&ldquo;rags of Rome,&rdquo; checked the real progress of the Reformation
in the English church, but by a reaction which in the ordering of Divine
Wisdom, often makes the wrath of man to praise him, it appears to have
been the means of raising up an increased antagonism to error, in the
persons of men willing to suffer and <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>to
die for the cause of truth.&nbsp; It will perhaps be admitted that at
many periods of the history of what is called the English church, whilst
its nominal members numbered a large proportion of the whole population,
the actual number of the genuine disciples of Christ within its pale
were in small compass.&nbsp; The revival in some measure, of the spirit
of its reformers, even in opposition to the letter of many of its formularies,
has, no doubt, in past times, done much to increase its living influence
and usefulness, but recent events have shown how large a portion of
its clergy instead of going forward in the work of the Reformation,
are rather desirous of retrograde movement, and of approximating, if
not of entirely returning to the errors of Rome.&nbsp; Such, we ought
ever to bear in mind, is the natural tendency of man, and so prone is
he, even when raised by the True Light to a perception of the things
which are most excellent, to sink again into the grovelling habits of
his own dark nature.</p>
<p>We come now to the threshold of our own religious history, and shall
endeavour to answer, in substance at least, the queries with which we
commenced the present inquiry.&nbsp; It was certainly an <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>extraordinary
period of our national religious history, in which the Society of Friends
arose&mdash;a time in which old foundations were shaken, and an earnest
inquiry excited in many minds after the way of truth and of real peace
to the soul.&nbsp; We think that it is not assuming, to express our
belief, that a remarkable extension of spiritual light and energy was
extended to the people of England, in that day, when George Fox, and
his early associates, went forth through the length and breadth of the
land, and found so extraordinary a preparation for their service in
the hearts of their fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p>The first preachers knew a being made Christians themselves, before
they went forth to call others to Christ&mdash;what a deep sense of
sin and of its hatefulness in the sight of God&mdash;what earnestness,
or rather agonizing in prayer&mdash;what joy in the sense of the true
knowledge of Christ, and of communion with him in Spirit&mdash;what
subsequent watchfulness and reliance upon him in every step of their
course&mdash;what zeal in making known the truth which they had found,
and what constancy in suffering for it, yea thinking it all joy that
they were counted worthy to suffer for the name of <!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>Christ!&mdash;Such
were the men who were heralds of our religious Society, and by whose
instrumentality thousands at least, were convinced of the truth; large
numbers of whom gave evidence that they were not only convinced, but
converted to God.&nbsp; Need we then wonder at their success? though
still compared with the numbers to which they preached, the converts
may be said to have been <i>few</i>.&nbsp; It was still the <i>many</i>,
who if brought to see as it were their face in a glass, went away and
straightway forgot what manner of men they were.</p>
<p>We believe that the number of persons who went under the name of
Friends, in Great Britain and Ireland, at the close of the 17th century,
was at least three times as great as it is at the present time.</p>
<p>It will be in accordance with our object, to endeavour to indicate
what may have been the chief causes of the suspension of those active
measures which we have called aggressive,&mdash;though full of love,
and which marked the early periods of our Society.&nbsp; An historian
of the church, who was not insensible of what constitutes true religious
energy, has stated, that extraordinary revivals of this kind, have rarely
been maintained <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>in
their primitive vigour more than about forty years.&nbsp; Rather more
than that time elapsed between the commencement of George Fox&rsquo;s
labours and their close, at the time of his death.&nbsp; About eight
days previous to that event, he attended a meeting of ministers, in
London, and one of those who was present says: &ldquo;I much minded
his exhortation to us, encouraging friends that have gifts to make use
of them; mentioning many countries beyond the seas that wanted visiting,
instancing the labours and hard travels of friends in the beginning
of the spreading of truth in our days, in breaking up of countries,
and of the rough ploughing they had in steeple houses, &amp;c., but
that now it was more easy; and he complained, that there were many Demases
and Cains who embraced the present world, and encumbered themselves
with their own business, and neglected the Lord&rsquo;s, and so were
good for nothing; and he said, they that had wives, should be as though
they had none; and who goeth a warfare should not entangle himself with
the things of this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This characteristic extract will suggest, probably, to many readers,
our object in quoting it.&nbsp; <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>If
there was cause for the reproof conveyed in it in that day, in which
we know the primitive zeal still burned brightly, what must we say of
the subsequent, and of the present state of our little church!</p>
<p>Long after the death of George Fox, there continued to be a large
increase to the numbers of friends; many who had been wise and great
in this world, were made to rejoice in the laying down of their outward
wisdom, and in sitting down in deep humility to learn of Jesus, by the
teaching of the Holy Spirit in the heart.&nbsp; These were prepared
boldly to declare God&rsquo;s controversy with sin, and the means by
which it might be subdued, not omitting to proclaim the alone ground
of a sinner&rsquo;s pardon through the propitiatory sacrifice of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We believe certainly that it has never been permitted to our Society
to be without its faithful labourers in the gospel, or without many
sincere confessors of its doctrines, who, by life and conversation,
have been true preachers to their brethren, and to the world in general.&nbsp;
Yet we must confess, that whilst as a Society, we continue to profess
the same religious views as were <!-- page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>held
and promulgated by our early Friends, we fear we do not come up in practice
to that pure standard to which they attained.&nbsp; The door is open
to all the world, yet we sit at ease in our ceiled houses.&nbsp; Many
around us are hungering and thirsting for the knowledge of God, yet
we are occupied with our farms and our merchandise.&nbsp; Let us not
be inquiring, &ldquo;What shall this man do,&rdquo; or what should the
other have done? but remembering the reproof, &ldquo;What is that to
thee, follow <i>thou</i> Me,&rdquo; submit ourselves to that humbling,
but preparing hand, which was so signally displayed in the cause of
those who were engaged in the planting and watering of our religious
Society.&nbsp; Then might we again hope to witness an increase of spiritual
life and vigour in the body, and thus become as &ldquo;a city set upon
a hill, that could not be hid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George Baker</span>, <i>Askham Field</i>, <i>York</i>.&nbsp;
An Elder.&nbsp; 71 1mo. 26 1850</p>
<p>He was one who remembered his Creator in the days of his youth, and
who proved in his own experience, that &ldquo;the fear of the Lord&rdquo;
is not only &ldquo;the beginning of wisdom,&rdquo; but that it is also
&ldquo;a fountain of life preserving from the snares of death.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His earnest desire was to be found walking acceptably before God; and
while a <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>young
man, he became greatly distressed at being overcome by drowsiness in
meetings for worship.&nbsp; On one occasion, when this had been the
case, he retired to a secluded spot, under a hedge, where, with many
tears, he poured forth his prayers for deliverance from this besetment.&nbsp;
Many years afterwards, when accompanying a friend on a religious visit
to the families of that meeting, he pointed out the place, and remarked
with expressions of gratitude, that from that time, he did not remember
having been overcome in the same manner.</p>
<p>He was deeply impressed with the words of his Saviour: &ldquo;All
things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them,&rdquo; and he so carried this precept out into practice, as
to become remarkable for his uprightness of character, and for his consideration
for others.</p>
<p>The following circumstances present instructive examples of the kindly
sympathy of this &ldquo;good Samaritan:&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the occurrence of a malignant fever, in one of the eastern dales
of Yorkshire, while he resided in that district, he left his own home
for several weeks, to nurse some of his neighbours who had <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>become
affected with the disease, devoting his whole time to the sick, while
dread of infection rendered it difficult for him to obtain assistance
in this office of mercy.</p>
<p>After his removal into the neighbourhood of York, and at a time when
many persons were returning past his premises from a contested Election,
and some of them so much intoxicated as to be incapable of taking care
of themselves; fearing lest any severe accident should befall them while
in this condition, he took several of them from the highway, and lodged
them in one of his outhouses, dismissing them on the following morning
with suitable but kind admonition.&nbsp; And when numbers of the Irish
poor were driven from their own country by famine, and wandered about
in this land &ldquo;for lack of bread,&rdquo; he sheltered many of them
in his out-buildings and ministered to their necessities.</p>
<p>George Baker occupied the station of Elder for many years, exercising
a fatherly care in the church, and extending counsel or encouragement,
as he saw occasion, with a simplicity and godly sincerity which gave
him great place amongst his friends.&nbsp; He was often applied to by
his <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>neighbours
for counsel, and as a peace-maker; and in serving them was remarkable
for his patience, self-denial, and success.&nbsp; In his latter years,
his powers both of body and mind failed greatly, in consequence of an
accident which he met with, while in the pursuit of his occupation as
a farmer; but having &ldquo;worked while it was day,&rdquo; he was preserved
through a period which might be spoken of as &ldquo;a night, in which
no man could work;&rdquo; so that love, that badge of discipleship with
Christ, shone brightly in his last moments, as from under the margin
of a dark cloud, and a solemn feeling of peace with God, through Jesus
Christ, pervaded his dying hours.</p>

<p>We have often had to observe, that many of our friends, who have
lived to a good old age, and who have been loved and honoured in their
respective stations, as upright pillars in the church, have left but
few written memorials of their course for the instruction of others;
whilst encompassed with infirmities, and looking for the help of the
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Lord&rsquo;s
Spirit to resist their manifold temptations and easily besetting sins,
they have been enabled to pursue the even tenor of their way, seeking
through divine grace to fulfil the day&rsquo;s work, in the day time,
and hoping to hear at last the call of mercy into one of the many mansions
prepared by Him, who has loved them and died for them.&nbsp; We love
to dwell upon this class of our departed friends, and without undervaluing
those whose gifts have been more prominent, or whom circumstances have
rendered more conspicuous in our pages, we sincerely desire that these
more hidden, but not less valuable parts of the spiritual building,
may ever be honoured amongst us.&nbsp; Such an one was our late friend,
William Binns.&nbsp; It was during his apprenticeship that, under the
ministry of two women friends, engaged in a family visit, he was powerfully
awakened to the eternal interests of his soul, and through divine grace,
the impression made, was of so decided a character, that putting his
hand to the Christian plough, he looked not back.</p>
<p>He was greatly concerned for the true welfare of our religious Society,
and in the district in which he resided was eminently useful; caring
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>for
the flock over which the good Shepherd had made him an overseer.</p>
<p>Sterling integrity and uprightness marked his character; his judgment
was clear and sound, and was frequently given in comprehensive and pertinent
language, free from all superfluous expression.</p>
<p>He took a very low estimate of his own attainments, and was humbled
under a sense of his shortcomings; as the shadows of evening were closing
around him, he frequently and feelingly intimated, that there was for
him, but one ground of faith and hope, the free mercy of God in Jesus
Christ his Saviour; such was the subject of his frequent expression
to his friends, and they rejoice in the belief that having in his long
pilgrimage taken up his cross, and sought above all things to follow
Christ, so in the end he was prepared to enter into the eternal joys
of his Lord.</p>

<p>This beloved friend was privileged beyond many in the pious care
exercised in her religious training.&nbsp; She became early acquainted
with the teachings of divine grace, and from childhood, appears highly
to have valued the holy scriptures.&nbsp; It was frequently her practice
to set apart some portion of the day for private retirement and meditation,
and in thus seeking to wait upon the Lord for the renewal of her spiritual
strength, she was favoured to know &ldquo;times of refreshing,&rdquo;
and a growth in &ldquo;pure and undefiled religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She loved the truth in sincerity, and her mind was enriched in the
instructive contemplation of its order, excellence and beauty, and the
benign and salutary influence it has on those who obey its requisitions:
fervently she craved for an increase of faith and strength, that she
might be found among the &ldquo;called, and chosen, and faithful.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;I
felt,&rdquo; she remarks on one occasion, &ldquo;as if I could make
any sacrifice called for; the language of my mind is almost continually,
what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the apprehension that it would be required of her publicly
to bear testimony to the power and sufficiency of divine grace, her
mind was greatly humbled, and under the pressure of religious exercise,
she thus records her feelings: &ldquo;Sweetly tendered in my room, and
craved for strength, fully and unreservedly, to yield all to Him, who
still in mercy visits me; if consistent with divine goodness, may my
mind be more illuminated, that I may more clearly distinguish between
my own will and the Lord&rsquo;s requirings.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was recorded
a minister in 1823; and on this important event she observes: &ldquo;Feeling
some quietude, humble desires are prevalent that I may indeed be watchful.&nbsp;
Dearest Lord! be pleased to hear my feeble though sincere aspirations
after increasing strength and wisdom.&nbsp; Thou knowest that I feel
awfully fearful lest I should bring any shade on thy blessed cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her connection in married life, introduced her into a large family,
the duties of which she cheerfully <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>performed
with maternal solicitude, and she became closely united in bonds of
affection to the several branches of the domestic circle, anxiously
promoting their religious and moral welfare.</p>
<p>In ministry, this dear friend was pertinent and edifying, at times
close and searching; in the exercise of her gift, she travelled at different
intervals in several of the English counties.&nbsp; In the summer of
1848 her health began to decline; her demeanour under pain and suffering
evinced her humble dependence upon the Lord, and the language of her
soul was, &ldquo;not my will, but thine, oh Father, be done!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some alleviation was permitted, and she so far recovered as to be able
to assemble with her friends for divine worship; on these occasions,
her communications evinced her undiminished interest in the cause of
truth and righteousness.&nbsp; In the last meeting she attended, she
bowed the knee in solemn supplication, craving for herself and those
present, the attainment of perfect purity and holiness, and that this
might be the chief concern of their lives.&nbsp; A few days after, she
was seized with paralysis, and although consciousness was not entirely
effaced, she said but little; she retained a grateful <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>sense
of her many mercies, and a fervent affection towards her husband and
near connections.&nbsp; Gradually declining, she passed away as falling
into a sweet sleep, and we cannot doubt exchanged the tribulations of
time, for the blissful joys of eternity.</p>

<p>In an unexpected hour, and in the enjoyment of usual health, it pleased
our heavenly Father to lay his hand of affliction upon this dear friend,
and after a severe illness of about four weeks, to gather her, as we
reverently believe, into &ldquo;the rest which remaineth for the people
of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears, that in early life, &ldquo;the grace which bringeth salvation,&rdquo;
wrought effectually in her heart, so that her surviving relatives cannot
recall the time when the fear of God did not influence her conduct;
her pious mother, who for many <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>years
filled the station of Elder in our Society; was deeply interested in
the religious welfare of her children, and earnestly sought, in the
morning of their day, to imbue their minds with the principles and precepts
of the gospel of Christ, and her labours of love in reference to this
beloved daughter were graciously owned.&nbsp; From her childhood, she
was more than commonly dutiful and affectionate to her parents, rarely
giving them any cause for uneasiness; an aged grandmother also, who
resided for many years with them, she waited on with such tender care,
as to call forth the expression of her belief, that a blessing would
rest on her on that account.</p>
<p>Great meekness, tenderness, and humility clothed her mind, not only
throughout the season of her affliction, but for a long course of previous
years, binding her in very tender bonds to her husband and children,
as well as to her other endeared relatives and friends.</p>
<p>It appears, from the first day on which her illness assumed a more
serious character, that an impression pervaded her mind, that it would
be unto death, and accompanying this impression, a deep and earnest
desire for entire resignation to <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the
divine will; and this desire was graciously answered; for during the
period of her illness, her resignation, and consequent tranquillity,
were indeed remarkable; attended by a precious measure of &ldquo;the
peace of God which passeth all understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp; So fully
was this the case, and so little of the appearance of death accompanied
her illness, that a lively hope of her restoration to health, was, even
to the last day of her life, earnestly cherished by those around her,
and in addition to this, such was the nature of her disease, that great
stillness and uninterrupted rest were considered necessary; thus circumstanced,
whilst both her mind, and their minds, were abundantly satisfied with
the precious evidence of the love of God in Christ Jesus, shed abroad
in her heart, they were not anxious for much expression, or careful
to commit to writing what, from season to season, fell from her lips;
feeling that her mind &ldquo;wore thanksgiving to her Maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She evinced, throughout her married life, a deep interest in the
well-being of her tenderly beloved children, making it her frequent
practice to spend some portion of her time in retirement with them,
in reading the holy scriptures and in <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>prayer;
and this interest increasingly appeared as she lay on the bed of affliction,
having them daily in her chamber, and again and again, in tender affection,
impressing on their minds the importance of divine and eternal things,
urging them to walk in the way of God&rsquo;s commandments, and to regard
his favour and approbation as the one thing, beyond all other things,
necessary both to their present peace and everlasting salvation: similar
counsel was also extended to the other members of her household and
family, to the friends who kindly visited her, to her medical attendants,
and to her neighbours.&nbsp; More might be said in reference to the
Christian graces which marked the character of this beloved friend,
but the object is not to magnify the creature, but to set forth the
excellency and sufficiency of the &ldquo;grace which is from God our
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and by the effectual operation
of which, she was what she was.&nbsp; The last words she addressed to
her tenderly beloved husband were: &ldquo;All is well:&rdquo; and again,
shortly before the final close: &ldquo;My foundation is on the Rock;&rdquo;
that Rock, we undoubtingly believe, which &ldquo;no tempest overthrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sudden death, by Cholera, of this dear young friend, caused at
the time a very lively emotion among a wide circle of friends.&nbsp;
She was the only and much beloved child of her bereaved parents;&mdash;naturally
of a most amiable disposition, and of that lively temperament which
gives a peculiar zest to life and all its passing enjoyments, she diffused
around her somewhat of the buoyancy and sunshine which seemed ever to
attend her own steps.&nbsp; Thus attractive and admired, and drinking
largely of the cup of present pleasures, the thoughts of the future
appear to have had but little place in her mind.&nbsp; In a state of
excellent health, she had gone to <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Mountmelick
to pass a few weeks with some near relatives, when she was seized with
the disorder which, in a few hours, closed her life.&nbsp; Those hours
were passed in much bodily suffering, but sorer still were the conflicts
of her mind.&nbsp; The scales which had prevented her from seeing the
real worth of life and the awful realities of the future, at once fell
from her eyes, and she saw or rather felt with indescribable clearness,
that the great truths which appertain to the welfare of the soul belong
alike to the young and the healthy, to the sick and the dying.&nbsp;
She saw that she had been living to herself and not to God, and this,
whatever particulars she might lament, was the heavy burden of her awakened
spirit.&nbsp; In the depths of contrition, and in the earnestness of
faith, she was enabled to pray to her heavenly Father, and Saviour,
to draw near and to have mercy upon her.</p>
<p>Thus passed some hours never to be forgotten.&nbsp; The rapid progress
of her disease hardly allowed time for much further mental exercise
or expression.&nbsp; She sank into a state of quietude of body and of
mind.&nbsp; And when all was over, the sorrowing parents were condoled
in the hope, that <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the
prayers of their beloved child had been heard, through the mercy of
Him who never turned away his ear from the truly repentant suppliant.</p>
<p>What lessons does this brief narrative offer to survivors.&nbsp;
Awfully does it speak to the children of pleasure, of the inestimable
value of the soul&mdash;of the importance of time&mdash;of the folly
of living in forgetfulness of God, and unmindful of their high destiny
as immortal beings.&nbsp; What a light does it throw on the responsibility
of parents; and whilst affording no encouragement to delay in the hope
of a death-bed repentance, what a view does it open of the infinite
mercy of our heavenly Father in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to pursue faithfully the path of manifested duty,
we believe it was peculiarly the aim of this dear friend, &ldquo;to
do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was of a very diffident disposition, and cautious in giving expression
to his religious feelings, lest he should thereby make a profession
beyond what he thought his attainments warranted.</p>
<p>For many years he laboured under a disease, which was attended with
much suffering; but this proved a means of weaning him from the world
and its pursuits, and of inducing him more earnestly to &ldquo;seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,&rdquo; with the unshaken
belief that all things necessary would be added.</p>
<p>He manifested a deep interest in the prosperity of our religious
Society, and according to his <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>measure,
especially in the latter part of his life, willingly devoted himself
to its service.&nbsp; He likewise took great delight in promoting the
best interests of the juvenile portion of the population in the neighbourhood
in which he resided; and the counsel he gave to those of this class,
often gained their good will and respectful attention.&nbsp; He also
exhibited a very humane disposition toward the animal creation, and
rarely allowed a case of ill-treatment or oppression to pass without
attempting to redress the wrongs inflicted.&nbsp; For some years, he
took great interest in supplying the crews of foreign vessels, resorting
to the port of Dover, with copies of the holy Scriptures and religious
tracts; and from his kind and unassuming manners, his efforts were almost
universally well received.</p>
<p>His last illness, of four months&rsquo; duration, was attended with
extreme bodily suffering; but the nature of his complaint being very
obscure, he entertained a hope that he might be restored to his former
state of health, and expressed some anxiety for length of days, in order
that he might be more useful to his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; But as his
strength declined, this desire gave way to quiet submission <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>to
the will of his God; and it was evident, that his soul was anchored
upon that Rock, which alone can support in the hour of trial.</p>
<p>Soon after he was taken ill, he remarked in allusion to his business,
that he had thought it right in one instance, to decline the execution
of an order, where more display of taste was required, than he could
feel satisfied with; and this sacrifice, with some others of a similar
kind, had afforded him peace: adding, &ldquo;I do want to come clean
out of Babylon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, the language had been much upon
his mind: &ldquo;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me,
and I shall be whiter than snow:&rdquo; and also the words of our Saviour,&mdash;&ldquo;If
I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being in great pain, he said,&mdash;&ldquo;You must pray for me,
that my patience may hold out; I have indeed need of your prayers, for
my sufferings are very great; but, bye and bye, perhaps I may be able
to say, I have not had one pang too many.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time,
he supplicated thus: &ldquo;Merciful Father, be pleased to grant me
a little ease, O! Thou that makest the storm a calm, and sayest to the
waves, Peace be still.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>which
he lay quiet; and whilst tears of gratitude flowed down his cheeks,
he said, &ldquo;Do not disturb me; all is stillness,&mdash;what a mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion, when feeling exceedingly depressed, he remarked,
that the vessels he had visited, and the poor sailors were brought mentally
to view, one after another, with much sweetness, and whilst he took
no merit to himself, he desired to encourage others to do what they
could for the good of the poor.&nbsp; At another time, after giving
instructions to one of his sisters, to make some selection of tracts
for the sailors on board a German vessel, then lying in the harbour,
he observed: &ldquo;Oh, what a field of labour there is! how I do wish
that some one would take this up, for I feel as though I should be able
to do very little more in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind, during his illness, seemed filled with love and gratitude.&nbsp;
He remarked, &ldquo;I never felt so much love before, both to my family
and friends; I do believe this illness will bind us more closely together
than ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again: &ldquo;Oh, how kind you are to wait
upon me so; the Lord will reward you!&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time,
he said, &ldquo;I had not thought to have been taken <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>at
this time of my life, but I am in such a critical state, that life hangs
on a thread;&mdash;the pains of the body are what I seem most to dread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On inquiring one day, where that line was to be found, &ldquo;At
ease in his possessions,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I do not think I
have been at ease in mine, I have endeavoured to live loose to them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A hope being expressed that his illness would be sanctified to him,
he quickly replied, &ldquo;Yes, and not to me only, but to all of you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He gave some directions, in the event of his death, with much composure,
observing: &ldquo;It seems an awful thing for me to say thus much, but
a great favour to be so free from anxiety.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the night
he was heard to say: &ldquo;No merit of mine, it is all of mercy, free
unmerited mercy!&rdquo;&nbsp; On a young man in his employment coming
to assist him, previous to going to his own place of worship, when about
to leave the room, he thus addressed him: &ldquo;Mind and make a good
use of the time, and do not be afraid of looking into thy own heart,
but suffer the witness to come in and speak, whether it be in the language
of encouragement or reproof.&nbsp; Many persons go to their places of
worship, where much of the time is spent in singing and in music, which
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>please
the outward ear, but this is not religion!&nbsp; It is when we are brought
to see ourselves as we really are, sinners in the sight of a holy God,
that we are led to seek a Saviour, and to cry, in sincerity, &lsquo;A
Saviour, or I die!&nbsp; A Redeemer, or I perish for ever!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On its being remarked to him, that it was consolingly believed, he
was one of those who had endeavoured to occupy with his talent, which,
if only one, it was hoped, had gained an increase, he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;That
will only be known at the great day of account, when weighed in the
balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Seventh-day evening preceding his decease, he remarked to a beloved
relative, that it seemed the safest for him to say but little in regard
to his own attainments, adding,&mdash;&ldquo;My desire is, for a continuance
of kind preservation.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on the day before his death,
he remarked with gratitude, that his intellects had been preserved clear
throughout his illness.&nbsp; During the night, he was much engaged
in prayer; his bodily powers were fast sinking, but his mind appeared
preserved in peaceful serenity.&nbsp; In the morning, he expressed a
desire that his sister would remain by him, affectionately <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>inquired
for his father, and soon after, we reverently believe, exchanged a state
of suffering for one of never-ending rest and joy, in the everlasting
kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hannah Neale</span>, <i>Mountmelick</i>.&nbsp;
Daughter of William Neale.&nbsp; 33 3mo. 29 1850</p>
<p>Hannah Neale had an extensive circle of acquaintance, by whom she
was much beloved and esteemed, as being one of a very innocent and blameless
life.&nbsp; Some of the circumstances relating to her, are of a very
affecting and interesting character, and speak loudly the uncertainty
of all earthly prospects.&nbsp; In the summer of last year, she entered
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>into
an engagement of marriage with a friend residing in England.&nbsp; Having
considered the subject with earnest and sincere desires to act in accordance
with best wisdom, she looked forward to the completion of the prospect
with a pleasing and hopeful confidence, yet even at an early period
of the engagement, there was something that seemed to whisper to her,
the uncertainty of its completion.</p>
<p>At this time she appeared in her usual health and full of spirits;
but whilst on a visit to her aunt, at Kingstown, her health became affected,
and from this time, symptoms exhibited themselves, which baffled all
medical skill.&nbsp; She was still, however, hopeful respecting her
own recovery, and very often expressed in her correspondence, how much
she was pained by the thought of being the cause of so much anxiety
to others,&mdash;that her own sufferings were trifling, and the comforts
surrounding her so numerous, she felt that she had every thing to be
thankful for.&nbsp; It was, however, evident to those around her, that
there was little ground for hope, and a dear friend intimated to her,
that her medical advisers considered her end might possibly be very
near.&nbsp; This intelligence <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>greatly
startled her, but she afterward expressed, how thankful she felt that
she had been honestly apprized of her danger.</p>
<p>The solemn impression then made on her mind, never left her, and
her constant desire was, that she might, through divine mercy, be made
meet for the kingdom of heaven, repeating emphatically, &ldquo;I have
much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She often expressed her great sorrow, that she had not yielded to
the serious impressions with which she had been favoured, saving, &ldquo;They
were soon scattered;&rdquo; and regretted much that she had not lived
a more devoted life.&nbsp; She felt herself to be a great sinner, needing
a Saviour&rsquo;s gracious pardon; and for a long time feared she never
should obtain that forgiveness, she so earnestly longed for.&nbsp; But
though her faith was feeble, she endeavoured to lay hold of encouragement
from the mercy extended to the Prodigal Son, and to the Thief upon the
cross, hoping that the same mercy might be extended to herself; but
for a long time, her poor tossed and tried mind &ldquo;could find nothing
to lean upon.&rdquo;&nbsp; She remarked, she could not feel that she
had sinned against her fellow-creatures, but that she could <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>adopt
the words of the Psalmist: &ldquo;Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,&rdquo;
saying, &ldquo;I feel that I have nothing to build upon, and that I
want every thing; I am not prepared to die, I want all my sins to be
forgiven; I hope I shall not be taken till the work be fully accomplished.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The whole of the 51st Psalm, she said, seemed to suit her case, and
with solemnity repeated, &ldquo;&lsquo;Create in me a clean heart, oh
God! and renew a right spirit within me.&rsquo;&nbsp; If I am saved,
it will indeed be at the eleventh hour, I have been such a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus did the Spirit of Truth search all things, and bring this beloved
friend sensibly to feel, as she weightily expressed, &ldquo;that at
such a solemn hour, it will not do to build upon having led a spotless
and innocent life, something more is then wanted to lean upon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She often observed, how well it was for those who had given up their
hearts to serve their Saviour in the time of health,&mdash;that had
she done so, she should not now, in the hour of trial, have had to feel
such deep sorrow of heart,&mdash;that she could only hope for mercy
and forgiveness, adding, &ldquo;If I perish, let it be at Thy footstool.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>As
her bodily weakness increased, she remarked, &ldquo;I often feel unable
to read, or even to think; but I can <i>cling</i>; this is about as
much as I am able to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though this beloved friend took these low views of her own state,
her company was deeply instructive and edifying to those around her,
and a heavenly sweetness marked her deportment.&nbsp; Her heart was
often filled with gratitude to her heavenly Father for the extension
of his love and mercy, and she remarked many times, &ldquo;I have indeed
been mercifully dealt with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dear sufferer rapidly declined; yet her mind continued bright,
and she was preserved in a patient, waiting state, fully conscious of
the approach of death, she queried how long it was thought likely she
might live? praying,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! dear Saviour, may it please thee
not to take me till the work be fully accomplished.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
often said, &ldquo;It is a solemn thing to die;&rdquo; and the evening
preceding her death, when her friends were watching around her, she
remarked that, believing her end was near, &ldquo;It felt very, very
solemn to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this deeply interesting season, He who
is indeed Love, condescended <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>in
great mercy to draw near, so that she seemed lifted above terrestrial
things, and permitted a foretaste of those joys, of which we consolingly
believe, she now fully participates.&nbsp; Under this precious influence,
her countenance beamed with sweetness, and she emphatically repeated
many times,&mdash;&ldquo;Divine compassion! mighty love!&rdquo; and
raising her hand, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh such love!&mdash;such love!&mdash;and
to me such a sinner; is it not marvellous?&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;a weary
burdened soul, oh Lord, am I, but the blood of Jesus can wash the guilty
sinner clean.&mdash;Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil.&mdash;Oh how wonderful! hard things have
been made easy, and bitter things sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remarked that, at such a solemn hour, the world had no relish,
&ldquo;oh no!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is not worth a thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The world recedes, it disappears,<br />
Heaven opens on my eyes, my ears.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To a young friend whom she tenderly loved, she said, &ldquo;Oh if
we should all meet in heaven, will it not be delightful? oh! dear ---,
we must all come to this, and nothing will do for any of us but the
blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>She
continued for some time addressing those around her in this strain;
and to the question of her brother, whether she was happy? she replied,
&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I am happy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus her dying lips seemed
to testify, that she was mercifully brought to see the salvation of
God, and that he is able to save to the uttermost all those who come
unto him, through faith in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Henry Neild</span>, <i>Over Whitley</i>, <i>Cheshire</i>.&nbsp;
An Elder.&nbsp; 59 10mo. 4 1849</p>
<p>In the removal of this beloved friend, we have another instance of
the uncertainty of time, and another call to prepare for the life to
come.&nbsp; Henry Neild left home on the 12th of 9th month, 1849, for
the purpose of attending his Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, at Nantwich;
but he was taken ill in the former meeting, and though relieved by medical
aid, it failed to remove disease, which continued daily to waste his
frame, and in little more than three weeks terminated his earthly pilgrimage;
and we thankfully believe, through redeeming mercy, translated the immortal
spirit to &ldquo;an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth
not away.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>He
had long been a very useful and willing helper in the small Quarterly
Meeting, of which he was a member; and a true sympathizer with the afflicted,
taking heed to the apostolic injunction, &ldquo;Bear ye one anothers
burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deep and fervent
were his desires for the welfare of our Society, for the maintenance
of all our religious testimonies, and that its members might be redeemed
from the influence and spirit of the world.</p>
<p>In the early part of his illness, he remarked that &ldquo;it was
surprising to himself, how entirely he could leave all earthly things;
he had desired to leave all to Him who doeth all things well; and to
commit himself into the hands of his dear Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time, he said, &ldquo;I am very gently and mercifully
dealt with, I feel that I am a poor unfaithful creature, but I consider
it a favour to be made sensible of this, for it is only of divine mercy
that we can rightly feel our need.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus kept in humble
reliance upon the mercy of God, in Christ Jesus his Saviour, he was
permitted to repose on that &ldquo;Anchor to the soul which is sure
and steadfast,&rdquo; and to cast all his care upon our compassionate
and ever present Redeemer.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>He
died at Nantwich, at the house of Croudson Tunstall, whose own death
took place little more than a month afterwards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William Newsom</span>, <i>Limerick</i>.&nbsp;
62 6mo. 18 1850</p>
<p>In affixing a few lines to this name, the desire is simply to arrest
the attention of any reader, who may be too closely engaged in temporal
things; giving their strength to that which cannot profit, and not sufficiently
pondering the passing nature of all terrestrial things.</p>
<p>William Newsom had been extensively engaged in commerce through great
part of his life, and there was reason to fear he was unduly absorbed
by its cares and allurements: for the last year or more, he appeared
to be becoming more sensible that disappointment was stamped upon his
pursuits; his bodily health heretofore unbroken, began also to decline,
and it was comfortingly believed by his friends, that this and other
revolving circumstances, were tending to turn the energies of his mind
from perishable, to imperishable objects.&nbsp; A few months before
his decease, it became still more evident, that the hand of his heavenly
Father was laid upon him in mercy; and on one occasion, he remarked,
&ldquo;that he saw <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>nothing
in the world worth living for, it abounded in trouble and disappointment,
all outward things were stained in his eyes, there was nothing but religion
that could be of any avail for any of us; and it mattered not when we
were taken&mdash;young, old, or middle aged&mdash;if we were but ready,
that was the great point!&rdquo;&nbsp; His experience, however, during
the last few days of his life shewed, that although the ground might
have been prepared, the work was by no means effected; deep and sore
conflict was then his portion, and oh! with what fervency did he call
upon his Saviour, beseeching him in his mercy to be pleased to look
down upon his poor unworthy creature, for he alone could help in that
awful hour.&nbsp; Once he exclaimed, &ldquo;what could all the world
do for me now?&rdquo;&nbsp; His wife, under great exercise of spirit,
replied, &ldquo;Nothing! the best, when laid upon such a bed as thou
art, have nothing to look to or depend upon, but the mercy of the Saviour;&rdquo;
the poor sufferer earnestly pleaded that that mercy might be extended
to him, remarking, &ldquo;He has all power in heaven and in earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He then fervently prayed that the Lord would save his never dying soul.&nbsp;
It is believed, that whilst his many <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>sins
of omission and commission were brought vividly before his view, by
the unflattering witness, he was made very fully sensible that the great
work of salvation rests between the soul of man and his Creator, and
that &ldquo;no man can redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom for
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through the night, he was mostly engaged in prayer,
with uplifted hands invoking for mercy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Some time before his death, the great conflict of mind he had been
under, appeared to subside, and to be succeeded by a sweet calm, and
he intimated to his wife, that he felt comfortable and satisfied.&nbsp;
Till within half an hour of the close, prayer continued flowing from
his lips, the last audible sounds being an appeal to the Lord; and but
a few minutes before he ceased to breathe, a conscious look at his dear
wife, seemed to say, &ldquo;all is peace;&rdquo; and it was granted
to her exercised spirit to believe, that the unshackled soul when released,
was received into a mansion of rest, through the mercy and merits of
his Lord and Saviour.&nbsp; In reference to that impressive hour this
dear relative writes,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! how many times that solemn night,
did I long that all the world could feel the great necessity, whilst
in <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>health
and strength, so to live, as to be prepared for that awful hour, which
sooner or later must come upon us all; it is a very dangerous thing
to put off the work of the soul&rsquo;s salvation to a deathbed, or
to depend upon mercy being extended as at the eleventh hour, for it
may not then be found.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us then be concerned to work
whilst it is called to-day, and be ready to meet the awful summons,&mdash;&ldquo;Steward
give up thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Jane Prideaux</i>, <i>Kingsbridge</i>.</p>
<p>The decease of this friend is recorded in the Annual Monitor of last
year.&nbsp; We have since been furnished with the following notice of
her.</p>
<p>Our beloved friend, Jane Prideaux, died the 26th of the Second month,
1849, aged 87 years: for many years before her decease, she filled very
acceptably the station of Elder, and therein approved herself a lowly
follower of her Lord and Master.&nbsp; Very precious to her surviving
friends, is the remembrance of her innocent, circumspect walk, holding
out as it does in an impressive manner, <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the
invitation, &ldquo;Follow me as I have followed Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp;
During the latter years of her lengthened life, the fruits of her faith
became increasingly prominent, and she was endeared to her friends and
neighbours around her in no common degree.&nbsp; But it was during the
last two months of her life, when under great bodily suffering, that
her tongue was more fully set at liberty to declare the lovingkindness
of the Lord, who in this season of trial was graciously pleased to lift
up the light of his countenance upon her, and to grant a full evidence
of acceptance with himself, enabling her to rejoice in the assurance
that when her earthly house of this tabernacle should be dissolved,
there would be granted to her &ldquo;a building of God, a house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her patient, cheerful endurance of bodily pain was striking and instructive;
and in some seasons of closest conflict, her faith was strong, and her
acknowledgment of the supporting power of God, full and fervent.&nbsp;
She often said, the Lord was able to save and to deliver to the uttermost,
and would deliver <i>her</i>, when patience had had its perfect work.&nbsp;
Very impressive were her short petitions to the <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Father
of mercies, for his support and deliverance, accompanied as they constantly
were with the addition, &ldquo;if consistent with thy will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She remarked, &ldquo;I am in the hands of an unerring Creator, He <i>cannot</i>
err.&nbsp; We must not look to ourselves, but to our Saviour, who loved
us and gave himself for us&mdash;even for <i>me</i>, the most unworthy
of his creatures.&nbsp; He healeth all my diseases, and I have many,
but my mercies outweigh them all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Love and interest for
her friends seemed often to dwell in her heart beyond the power of expression.&nbsp;
Speaking of those who were members of the meeting to which she belonged,
she sent messages to each, and made appropriate remarks respecting them
individually, dwelling with especial comfort on the remembrance of those
among them who were bearing the burden of the day, and labouring to
promote their great Master&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; She afterwards said,
whilst tears of tenderness flowed, &ldquo;Oh! how many comfortable meetings
I have had in that little meeting-house, how have I loved to go and
sit there!&nbsp; It was not a little illness that kept me away: and
how has it rejoiced my heart to see individuals come in, who have been
as the anointed and sent!&rdquo;&nbsp; On being <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>told
one morning that Friends were going to meeting, she said, &ldquo;May
they know the Sun of righteousness to arise as with healing in his wings;&rdquo;
emphatically adding, &ldquo;I think they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At another time she sent messages of love to many of the members
of her Monthly Meeting, adding with an expression of feeling, to which
those around could not be insensible.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I cannot name
all; my love is universal; God is love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One night, when in great pain, she acknowledged in grateful terms,
the kindness of her attendants, and her belief that a blessing with
a full recompense would be given them; and addressing one of them, she
continued, &ldquo;I love thee tenderly, and feel thee near in the best
life&mdash;in the truth that is blessed for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Afterwards,
she broke forth with an audible voice thus: &ldquo;Bless the Lord, oh
my soul! and praise him for all his benefits.&nbsp; What can I do! how
shall I praise him enough!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, as with melody of
soul, she added,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heavenly blessings without number,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gently falling on my head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After taking an affectionate farewell of those <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>around
her, and addressing them in an instructive and encouraging manner, she
added, &ldquo;I can heartily say, that death is robbed of its sting,
and the grave of its victory.&nbsp; Thanks be unto God who giveth the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, &ldquo;Praise
and magnify the Lord!&nbsp; Oh if I could sing, I would sing his praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To some beloved relatives, from a distance, who came to see her,
she testified of her faith, hope, and confidence,&mdash;acknowledged,
that although frail in body, she was strong in the Lord, and in the
power of his might; and expressed her desire, that they might all meet
where partings are not known, adding, &ldquo;goodness and mercy have
followed me all the days of my life; and there is a promise for the
poor in spirit that will be fulfilled, &lsquo;When the poor and needy
seek water and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was permitted to pass quietly away without any apparent pain,
and is now, we reverently and thankfully believe, an inhabitant of that
city &ldquo;which hath no need of the sun, neither of the <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>moon
to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is
the light thereof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It often pleases our heavenly Father to carry forward the work of
divine grace, in the hearts of his children, by means, and through dispensations,
altogether unfathomable to the finite comprehension of men; but the
humble believer, looking beyond the changing rugged path of this life,
with filial love and confidence can repose on the mercy and goodness
of the Lord, and believingly apply the language of our Saviour, &ldquo;What
I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In very early life, the subject of the present brief notice was made
sensible of the contriting influence of divine grace on her heart, so
that many of her earliest recollections were fraught with love to her
Saviour.</p>
<p>For many years, she was subject to attacks of illness of a very trying
character, in connection with which, she was brought as into the very
furnace of affliction, and earnest were her prayers, that &lsquo;patience
might have her perfect work,&rsquo; and that through faith in the wisdom
of her heavenly Father, she might become fully resigned <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>to
his holy will; and a sense of his supporting power and presence, were
often mercifully granted to her, in times of severest suffering.</p>
<p>Her last illness was short: two days previous to her decease, she
remarked, &ldquo;I have had an awful night,&rdquo; but added, &ldquo;my
mind is calm and peaceful, I can now <i>quite</i> say, &lsquo;Thy will
be done;&rsquo;&rdquo; and to the remark, &ldquo;His grace is sufficient
for thee,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;Oh yes! and without that, we can
do nothing; I cast all upon Him, and can say, I fully trust in His will,
and in His power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subject of this memoir was a native of Kingsbridge, Devonshire;
and was educated <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>among
Friends.&nbsp; He was not by birth a member of our Society, but was
received into membership a short time previous to his death.&nbsp; Having
been adopted by his uncle, he was taken to Ireland, when about fourteen
years of age, as an apprentice to one of the Provincial Schools, of
which his uncle was the superintendent.</p>
<p>Endowed with natural abilities well adapted for the acquisition of
knowledge, and possessing a taste for various branches of literature
and science,&mdash;gifted, too, with engaging manners and affability
of disposition, he became, as he grew up, a general favourite amongst
those with whom he associated, and his immediate relatives indulged
in fond hopes of his becoming an honourable and useful charter.&nbsp;
His best friends, however, were sometimes anxious on his account, lest
the caresses of the world should turn aside his feet from the path of
safety, and prevent that entire surrender of heart and life to the requirements
of the gospel, which alone consists with true Christian discipleship,
and affords a well-grounded expectation of real usefulness and permanent
well-being.&nbsp; But he was open to receive the admonitions of his
friends, and there is reason to believe that the voice of Christian
counsel was instrumental to his good.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>He
was never very robust; and his application to study, in addition to
his stated duties, was, perhaps, not favourable to bodily vigour.&nbsp;
Before the expiration of his apprenticeship, he became so enfeebled,
as to cause his relations much anxiety; and as his uncle and aunt had
withdrawn from the Institution, the Committee of the School kindly acceded
to their proposal to remove him to their own house.&nbsp; Here he soon
rallied; and in the summer, of 1848, applied for the situation of teacher
of Sidcot School.&nbsp; He entered upon the duties of the station with
earnestness and zeal; and the notice and encouragement which he there
received, tended both to render his occupation a delight, and to draw
forth the more hidden depths of his character.&nbsp; His heart was in
his work, and the field of labour particularly congenial to his taste.</p>
<p>A few months, however, sufficed to bring on a return of delicacy,
and rendered it advisable that he should retire for a while from active
duty; but the following year, apparently with renovated powers, he again
resumed his post.&nbsp; For a while, he appeared to think that his health
was becoming confirmed; but about the commencement of another <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>year,
he was rapidly brought low, and nearly disqualified for the performance
of his school duties.&nbsp; He was however retained in his office, with
delicate attention to his known wishes, until in the 4th month, 1850,
he was obliged to withdraw, and again make his uncle&rsquo;s house at
Mountmelick his home.&nbsp; The following extracts from letters and
memoranda written previous to his leaving Sidcot, show the state of
his mind at that period.</p>
<p>2nd mo. 10th.&nbsp; &ldquo;I often feel,&mdash;oftener than ever,
that the thread of life is in me weak,&mdash;very weak; and, oh! I am
sometimes almost overwhelmed with the retrospects, and prospects, this
feeling opens to my view.&nbsp; I feel that I have been pursuing false
jewels, sometimes those which have no appearance even of external brilliance,
and the <i>Pearl</i> has escaped my notice.&nbsp; I have, I believe,
earnestly desired that I may be enabled to see the true and real beauty
of the Pearl, and its inestimable value, in such a light, that nothing
may again warp my attention from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd mo. 23rd, 1850.&nbsp; &ldquo;My weakness of body, and frequent
illnesses, have brought before my mind the great uncertainty of my continuing
long <!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>in
this scene of probation.&nbsp; I feel that I have lived hitherto &lsquo;without
God in the world,&rsquo; plunged in sin and darkness; that my sins are
a greater burden than I can bear; and unless my all merciful God and
Father, through his dear Son, forgive them, and relieve me from them,
I fear they will draw me with them to the lowest grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe my heart&rsquo;s desire is, to walk in the narrow
way,&mdash;to be the Lord&rsquo;s on his own terms, and to be humbled
even in the dust.&nbsp; The evil one suggests, that I can never be forgiven,
and fills my soul with doubts and fears; but, oh Lord! thou hast said,
&lsquo;He that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd mo. 24th.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strong desires are in my heart, that I
may be favoured with an assurance of forgiveness; but, oh! I fear that
my repentance is not sincere, that the pride of the world still holds
place in my heart.&nbsp; Oh Lord!&nbsp; I pray thee that thou wilt use
thy sharp threshing instrument, and break in pieces all that is at variance
with thy holy will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is First-day.&nbsp; Be pleased to keep the door of my
lips, Oh Father! and reign absolutely in my thoughts; grant that meeting
may be a <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>time
of favour and visitation, and that I may be enabled to wait patiently
for thee.&nbsp; Oh! that I could keep the world from pouring on me as
a flood, at such times: Thou, gracious Father, canst enable me to do
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd mo. 1st.&nbsp; &ldquo;Struggles seem to be my portion, in which
the world, the flesh, and the devil often seem likely to get the victory.&nbsp;
Lord, grant through the blessed Saviour, that if I have found the good
part, nothing may be permitted to take it from me.&nbsp; I greatly desire
an increase of faith.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I feel the little I have fail
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6th.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! that none of the Lord&rsquo;s intentions respecting
me, may be frustrated by my disobedience and unwatchfulness.&nbsp; Oh!
I feel that I am indolent and very lukewarm, if not cold altogether,
in attending to my soul&rsquo;s salvation, and in doing all for the
Lord&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Thou knowest, oh Lord! that I am very weak
in body; but, oh! grant that I may not make that a cover for indolence
and lukewarmness.&nbsp; Thou hast known my peculiar trials, and I thank
thee that thou hast, through the dear Lamb, granted me strength to bear
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his return to Mountmelick, this dear <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>youth
lived seven weeks, and during this time his company was most sweet and
instructive; the tenor of his conduct and conversation being beautifully
regulated by the influence of the divine Spirit, bringing, in great
measure, as there was reason to believe, every thought into captivity
to the obedience of Christ; and the composure and serenity of his countenance,
clearly indicated the sweet peace which pervaded his mind.</p>
<p>About the end of Fifth Month, it became evident that the final change
was drawing near.&nbsp; This he was enabled to look to without dismay;
saying, when a fear was expressed that he could not continue long: &ldquo;I
cannot say that I have any fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the night of the 2nd of 6th Month, he said: &ldquo;I wish I could
feel a stronger assurance of acceptance with the Almighty;&rdquo; and
afterwards he requested to have the 23rd Psalm read to him.</p>
<p>The next morning, sitting up in his bed, he remarked: &ldquo;There
remaineth a rest for the people of God;&rdquo; and, after a pause, &ldquo;I
want more of that faith, of which I fear I possess so little; and yet,
when I have asked for what was proper and needful for me, it has not
been denied.&nbsp; I desire to be enabled to pass through the valley
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>of
humiliation, without much conflict; and then comes the valley of the
shadow of death:&mdash;only a shadow! the finger of God will guide safe
through, all those who put their trust in him: &lsquo;Yea, though I
walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil;
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The rod to chasten,
the staff to support!&nbsp; Oh! all that is of the world, and all that
is in it, are worthless in my sight.&nbsp; If the Lord has any work
for me to do on earth, I trust I am willing to do it; but if not, I
have no wish to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the beloved invalid broke forth with the following
expressions: &ldquo;The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want;&rdquo;
emphatically adding, &ldquo;What a very precious promise!&rdquo; and,
after a short pause,&mdash;&ldquo;Come now, and let us reason together,
saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white
as snow, though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool,&rdquo;
remarking, &ldquo;and this was under the old dispensation.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
I hope my sins are gone beforehand to judgment; but there seem to be
so many fresh sins, I have so much time that I do not improve as I ought;
but the poor weak body <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>and
this weak mind too!&rdquo;&nbsp; On its being remarked, that we did
not serve a hard master, he seemed comforted, and continued, &ldquo;Oh!
that I could see the pearl gates; but I fear I have not faith enough,
nor love enough to love Him perfectly who first loved me, and died for
me, yes! even for <i>me</i>!&nbsp; Oh! I desire to throw myself at his
feet; how I wish I could love him better, and serve him more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole of Fourth-day he seemed fast sinking, and calmly spoke
of death as very near.&nbsp; He craved for patience, again and again,
making use of many sweet expressions as his end drew near.&nbsp; &ldquo;O
Jesus! sweet Jesus, come!&rdquo; and placing his hands together, supplicated
thus: &ldquo;Oh, dear Lord! if it be thy will, be pleased to take me,
for the sake of thy dear Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, again, &ldquo;Thy will
be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remarked, &ldquo;I believe I am passing through
the dark valley of the shadow of death;&rdquo; and on the hope being
expressed that he would be supported through, he responded, &ldquo;Through
mercy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after this, he sank into a quiet sleep, which
lasted some hours; and, shortly after waking, the unfettered spirit
took its flight so gently, as scarcely to be perceptible to those around.</p>

<p>Dedication to the cause of truth, marked the character of our dear
friend; and divine grace wrought effectually in him&mdash;breaking the
obstructions of the natural mind&mdash;smoothing the rugged path of
life, and enabling him to rejoice in the mercy which followed him, and
which was his support through many tribulations.</p>
<p>It was his earnest desire to know <i>in himself</i> a growth in the
truth, and to have his building firm on the Rock of ages.&nbsp; His
diligence in the <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>support
of our meetings for worship and discipline, and the reverent frame of
his spirit in these meetings, was animating and exemplary to his friends,
as was also his daily circumspect walk.&nbsp; The chastenings of divine
love produced profitable experience, and being accepted by him, with
humble gratitude and prayerful submission, his heart was enriched by
spiritual blessings.&nbsp; When near the confines of time, and the power
of utterance nearly gone, he was reminded by a friend of the faithfulness
and tender mercy of our Saviour, when he emphatically replied,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That</i>
is my only comfort.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus under the rapid decay of the outward
man, he possessed a peaceful mind, in that blessed hope which had been
in his day, as the anchor to his soul&mdash;&ldquo;sure and steadfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>The
quiet acquiescence of this dear friend, in the divine will, under changes
of circumstances involving, to her energetic and lively mind, much suffering,
appeared to many of her immediate friends, deeply instructive.&nbsp;
In early life, she was, for several years, resident in the family of
her brother Stephen Waller, at Clapton; and during the long continued
illness of his wife, took charge of the family, including an interesting
group of young children, between whom and herself the tenderest affection
subsisted.&nbsp; On the restoration of her sister&rsquo;s health, she
came to reside with her brother Robert Waller, of York.</p>
<p>In the First month, 1829, at the solicitation of the committee, she
consented to undertake, for a time, the domestic care of the Boys&rsquo;
School, then first established by York Quarterly Meeting, in that city.&nbsp;
Though in delicate health, and with a voice which she could rarely raise
above a whisper, she soon became so warmly interested in the institution,
as to prevent the necessity for further inquiry for a female head.&nbsp;
Her active and executive mind, found here a large field of usefulness,
which she well occupied.&nbsp; Her kind interest in the institution,
the scholars <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and
the officers, increased from year to year.&nbsp; Her ability in providing
for and securing the comfort of all around her, always conspicuous,
was eminently so in times of sickness, whether of more or less severity.&nbsp;
On these occasions, besides her power of skilfully ministering to physical
comforts, her quiet spirit, knowing where she herself had sought and
found consolation, could direct others to the same unfailing Source.</p>
<p>At the close of the year 1836, in consequence of the decease of her
sister Hannah, the wife of Robert Waller, she was called from the scene
of her arduous, yet to her, pleasant labours; the beneficial results
of which were, the establishment of orderly arrangement, and plans of
domestic comfort, essential to the well-being of a school.&nbsp; She
remained with her brother at Holdgate, till the time of his second marriage,
when change was again her allotment.&nbsp; After a short absence from
York she finally settled there.&nbsp; Her declining health rendered
repose needful, although the liveliness of her spirits enabled her greatly
to enjoy frequent intercourse with her friends;&mdash;and the school,
the scene of her former labours, was an object of continued affectionate
interest.</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>In
recording these few incidents, which we well know, of themselves, are
of little importance, perhaps entirely insignificant to the general
reader, we believe, nevertheless, that a useful lesson may be conveyed.&nbsp;
The path of our dear friend was, remarkably, not one of her own choosing;
most of the changes of place and circumstance which she experienced,
involved much that was painful; yet under all, the quiet, peaceful,
thankful resignation which she was enabled to attain, shewed where her
hopes were anchored, and proved the power of divine grace to make hard
things easy.&nbsp; For many months previous to her decease, she was
confined to her couch, and latterly to her bed.&nbsp; During this period,
she bore with unrepining patience, much bodily suffering; but her cheerful
and energetic mind still retained its characteristic vigour.&nbsp; In
this, her last illness, the kind attentions, and tender cares, which
she had so often ministered to others, were abundantly repaid to herself.&nbsp;
In addition to the assiduous and faithful services of the family with
whom she had taken up her abode, and who became warmly attached to her,
she had for many weeks previous to her decease, the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>tenderest
attention of one of her affectionate nieces, of whose infant years she
had been the watchful guardian.</p>
<p>A friend who frequently visited her on her bed of suffering, says,
&ldquo;In some of my last visits to her, her expression of firm and
loving reliance upon the Lord, whose support she had been wont to seek
in the time of health, as well as in that of suffering, was a sweet
testimony to the blessedness of having made him her portion.&nbsp; She
told me how comforted she had been under great bodily weakness, when
she felt unable definitely to put up her petitions, in the lively remembrance
that she had a never-failing Advocate with the Father, touched with
a feeling of her infirmities, ever living to make intercession for her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she remarked, &lsquo;the sense of it has been precious
to me.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus peace and thankfulness were the frequent
clothing of her spirit, till her earthly house of this tabernacle was
quietly dissolved, and exchanged, we reverently believe, for &lsquo;a
house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alice Waller</span>, <i>The Howe</i>, <i>Halsted</i>.&nbsp;
Widow of Robert Waller, of York.&nbsp; 76 6mo. 25 1850</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Of
the childhood of our friend we know but little.&nbsp; Her parents were
members of our religious Society, and brought up their children in conformity
with its practices.&nbsp; She was, at rather an early age, placed at
the school for girls at York, which had, at that time, some peculiar
advantages in regard to the religious and moral care of the pupils.&nbsp;
But from this enclosure she was soon recalled, to be the companion of
her invalid mother; and at the early age of sixteen, when her beloved
parent was removed by death, she took the charge of her father&rsquo;s
domestic concerns, and resided with him till her marriage with Benjamin
Horner of York.</p>
<p>Although the shortness of the period she remained at school, might
be disadvantageous to her in several respects, yet it is highly probable
that, in her mother&rsquo;s sick chamber, some impressions were made,
and lessons learned, which were as seeds sown to bring forth fruit in
a future day.</p>
<p>Her husband&rsquo;s circle of acquaintance was an extensive, and,
in its character, a much varied one; and, for some years, Alice Horner
mingled much in gay society, occasionally frequenting with her husband
places of amusement, especially those <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>in
which music formed the chief attraction.&nbsp; But during this period,
in which she may be said to have lived to herself, she was not without
compunctuous visitations; and as the responsibilities of a mother came
upon her, she increasingly felt the seriousness of life, and the duty,
as well as the privilege, of living to God, and being enabled to look
unto Him as a Father and a Friend.</p>
<p>These feelings appear to have gradually gained ascendancy in her
mind, and her prevalent desire became, to be a Christian upon Christ&rsquo;s
own terms.&nbsp; She felt herself as one who had been forgiven much,
and therefore loved much,&mdash;striving to be no more conformed to
this world, but transformed by the renewing of her mind.&nbsp; Her conscience
became not only enlightened, but tender; and yielding to what she believed
to be her duty to God, she not only refrained from all the public amusements
in which she had formerly taken pleasure, but acted in her associations
with others, consistently with her views as a Friend.&nbsp; If in this
strait path; walking much alone and inexperienced in the way: she sometimes
erred, we believe it was rather on the side of decision, than on that
of undue yielding.&nbsp; She seemed to live under a sense <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of
that saying of the apostle, &ldquo;Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And whilst the course which she pursued could not fail to restrict,
in some degree, her intercourse with the world, those with whom she
still associated, (and her circle continued to be a wide one,) appeared
in general to estimate her motives; and many of them entertained an
increased love and respect for her character; and He who, above all
things, she desired to serve, was pleased abundantly to comfort and
strengthen her in all her trials.</p>
<p>The death of her only daughter, at the age of nineteen, as well as
that of her husband after a short illness, a few years subsequently,
were close trials to her; but she bowed in humble submission to these
dispensations, and, under the chastening hand of the Lord, it became
increasingly evident, that the &ldquo;one thing needful&rdquo; was steadily
kept in her view.&nbsp; She was diligent in her attendance of our religious
meetings, and often remarked, that she had been permitted to find in
them &ldquo;a resting place to her soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her second marriage, with Robert Waller of Holdgate near York,
her health, which for a long time had not been strong, began more rapidly
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>to
decline, and at the death of her husband, after a long and protracted
illness, she was so complete an invalid, as to be chiefly confined to
her bed for many months together.&nbsp; This was a great trial upon
her faith and patience; but her hope and trust in her Saviour&rsquo;s
love never forsook her, and often through her long illness, she was
enabled to look forward with hope and joy to that time, when &ldquo;absent
from the body,&rdquo; she should be &ldquo;present with the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months after her husband&rsquo;s death, she was removed, in an
invalid carriage, to the residence of her eldest son in Essex, whose
house continued to be her home the remainder of her days.&nbsp; In writing
to a much beloved friend, from this quiet retreat soon after her arrival,
she remarks,&mdash;&ldquo;Every comfort and every indulgence is allotted
to me by my attentive children.&nbsp; Oh what boundless demands upon
my gratitude are thus poured forth.&nbsp; I would gladly hope not without
a heartfelt acknowledgment to that Almighty Giver, who is the author
of all our manifold mercies.&nbsp; For all things I reverently thank
my God and Saviour, remembering you my dear friends, whom I have left,
with the truest affection.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>To
the same friend, who herself was suffering from illness, she again writes,
&ldquo;Oh, dearest ---, how many of His dear children does the Lord
keep long in the furnace, yet if he do but grant his presence there,
and watch over the refining process he designs to be accomplished, there
ought to be no complaining either of the length of time, or the severity
of the operation, but through all, the full fruits of resignation should
be brought forth in perfection, to his praise, and his glory.&nbsp;
That so it may be, my dear friend, forms a wish on my own account as
well as on thine, day by day.&nbsp; The time has appeared long to me,
that I have been required to lay under the rod, but when we measure
time as did the Apostle of old, and think of it as a vapour that quickly
passeth away, or as a shadow that abideth not, we see that it is but
for a little moment that our chastening can endure.&nbsp; I cannot forbear
beholding my day as far spent; but I do rejoice to see heaven as a place
of rest for me,&mdash;yes, even for me! through the blood shed for my
sins on Calvary&rsquo;s Mount.&nbsp; This mercy in Christ Jesus, how
precious it is to dwell upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice Waller loved the company of all those <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>that
loved the Lord Jesus, and especially the messengers of the gospel were
acceptable to her.&nbsp; On one occasion when receiving a visit from
a friend, whilst laid upon her bed of suffering, she, in great contrition,
expressed her sense of her heavenly Father&rsquo;s love and mercy to
<i>her</i>, a poor creature, adding, &ldquo;I feel bound to tell of
His marvellous goodness to me, even to me, by night and by day upon
my bed, in seasons of trial I have been comforted by my Saviour&rsquo;s
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Sixth Month, 1850, she became more poorly,
and both herself and her children were impressed with the belief that
her end was drawing near; on the 15th she passed a very trying day,
but in the evening revived a little and spoke most sweetly of the fulness
and clearness of her hope, and her perfect confidence in the love and
mercy of her God, extended to her for the sake of her beloved Saviour;
she was full of sweetness and affection to all around her, her heart
overflowing with gratitude to God and man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear Hannah
C. Backhouse,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;visited me a short time before
I came here, and she said, &lsquo;I believe Jesus has thrown his arm
of everlasting love around thee, and is drawing thee <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>nearer
and nearer to himself, and he will draw thee nearer and nearer, till
at last He will press thee into his bosom.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a sweet
message; I have often thought upon it since, and I now feel such close
union of spirit with God, that I cannot doubt it is even so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On the passage of Scripture being repeated, &ldquo;The angel of the
Lord encampeth round about them that fear him,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;yes,
and preserveth them.&mdash;&lsquo;This poor man cried, and the Lord
heard him and delivered him from all his troubles.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
fear of the Lord has been my support for many years past.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And on being reminded of that verse of Scripture, &ldquo;Thy rod and
thy staff they comfort me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;He has been my staff
and my rod in the dark valley of death, keeping my head above the waters,
and he has given me hope full of immortality,&mdash;full of immortality!
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever; I humbly trust
that such will be my portion.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then remarked &ldquo;It
is just a week to-day since I began to be so very ill;&mdash;strange
conflict of the body, with the mind so perfectly tranquil, in strong
confirmation of the blessed promise, &lsquo;Thou wilt keep him in perfect
peace whose mind is <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>stayed
on thee.&rsquo;&mdash;I have often thought I heard the song of Moses
and of the Lamb, as I lay here in deep exhaustion.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another
time she remarked, &ldquo;I have often sinned, and erred much, but I
have One in heaven that pleadeth for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hailed with much joy the arrival of a beloved friend, and spoke
of the event as filling up the only remaining desire she had on earth;
their meeting was a season of mutual love and thanksgiving to the Lord.&nbsp;
On Second day, the 24th, she said, &ldquo;I am so loosed from every
thing below, as I could not have believed;&rdquo; and in the evening
expressed that she was so filled with thankfulness her heart was overflowing!&nbsp;
She intimated her belief, when her room was made ready for the night,
that it would be the last she should have to pass, and the next morning
it became evident that she was rapidly sinking.&nbsp; It was said to
her that it was a long and trying travel, but she was near to a better
land! when she quickly responded, &ldquo;Yes, Emanuel&rsquo;s land:&rdquo;
and on its being remarked, &ldquo;The crown is nearly won;&rdquo; she
emphatically replied, &ldquo;Oh, I wish it were on!&rdquo;&nbsp; A short
time after this, her redeemed spirit was <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>gently
liberated from the shackles of mortality, to be, we humbly believe,
&ldquo;for ever with the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

in whom there was no guile.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had his <i>peculiarities</i>
of character, but with all, was <i>singularly good</i>, and we cannot
doubt <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>that
his prayers and his alms, had come up for a memorial before Him, who
seeth in secret.</p>
<p>At the age of fifty, with an ample fortune, he relinquished a business,
in which he had most diligently laboured, when the full tide of prosperity
was flowing in upon him, in order that he might devote his time, and
the means placed by Providence at his disposal, to the cause of neglected
and suffering humanity.</p>
<p>For more than thirty years it became the essential and exclusive
employment of his life, to explore and to relieve cases of poverty and
distress, and in the accomplishment of this undertaking, he employed
the same assiduity and care, which he had been wont to exercise in the
management of his secular calling, distributing many times at the rate
of a thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>As a steward of the gifts of God, he carefully invested his money
so as to secure a fair rate of interest, and on no occasion did he relax
from the utmost exactness in his monetary dealings; and yet it is believed
that his personal and domestic expenditure never reached &pound;150.
per annum.</p>
<p>His house, like his person, was a pattern of plainness and simplicity.&nbsp;
His furniture consisted <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of
nothing fashionable or superfluous; and his table was equally marked
by comfort and frugality.</p>
<p>He was a warm advocate in the cause of Temperance, and was deeply
interested in the subject of &ldquo;the prevention of Cruelty to Animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Tracts, he must have paid for, and circulated gratuitously, some
millions!&nbsp; His whole time and energies were fully employed, and
often heavily taxed, in devising and carrying out schemes of mercy and
benevolence, and his life presented one uniform tenor of consistent
piety.&nbsp; To strangers he might appear reserved, but his apparent
reserve only resulted from his constitutional modesty, and retiring
habits, whilst to those who enjoyed his friendship, he was frank, open,
and intelligent in no ordinary degree.</p>
<p>William Wilson was never robust, but toward the close of his life,
his feebleness became more apparent; for more than a week he was confined
to his bed, but without any urgent symptom of disease.&nbsp; His mind
was calm and peaceful,&mdash;he knew and loved his Saviour, and through
His mediation, we cannot doubt he has inherited the blessing to the
pure in heart, leaving behind him, in many respects, an example worthy
to be followed, <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>practically
bearing a noble testimony to &ldquo;christian moderation and temperance
in all things,&rdquo; and against that covetousness which is idolatry.&nbsp;
The memory of such a man is blessed.</p>

<p>Many, both within the limits of our own Society and out of it, can
bear testimony to the integrity, benevolence, and Christian deportment
of this dear friend.&nbsp; In his transactions with his fellow-men,
he was particularly careful not to over-reach, or to avail himself of
advantages subversive to their interests; and in the social circle,
as well as among the poor, his kindness of disposition was conspicuous.&nbsp;
During the scarcity of provision in Ireland, his liberality was great,
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and
his exertions on behalf of the destitute almost unremitting.</p>
<p>His illness commenced in the early part of the 9th month, 1849, and
on finding that the complaint did not yield to remedies, he expressed
his earnest desire for resignation to the divine will, remarking, that
whatever might be the termination, he believed &ldquo;all would be well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He intimated, that he had not been one who could give much expression
to his religious feelings, but that for many years his mind had been
daily exercised before the Lord on his own behalf, as well as on that
of his family.&nbsp; The prosperity of our religious Society lay very
near to his heart, and he expressed his earnest desire for its preservation
in &ldquo;humility and simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patience with which he bore the debility attendant upon his complaint
was remarkable; His mind expanded in love to his family, his friends,
and to all the world, repeating emphatically, &ldquo;I love them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frequently spoke of his willingness to depart; and as his illness
advanced, there appeared an increasing sweetness and solemnity in his
manner, and he mostly addressed those about him in <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>terms
of affection, expressing his thankfulness for their attention, and desiring
that the Lord would strengthen them.&nbsp; On a hope being expressed
that his mind was peaceful, he replied, &ldquo;Yes, quite so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He took an affectionate leave of his wife and those around him; after
which nature rapidly sank, and he quietly, and it is humbly believed,
peacefully expired.</p>

CHAPMAN BACKHOUSE.</h3>
<p><i>Died</i> 6<i>th of</i> 5<i>th month</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>Hannah Chapman Backhouse was the daughter of Joseph and Jane Gurney;
she was born at Norwich the 9th of 2nd Month, 1787.&nbsp; Of her very
early life she has left but little record.&nbsp; She disliked study,
and was fond of boyish sports, until about the age of thirteen, when
she began to feel enjoyment in reading.</p>
<p>Possessed of a naturally powerful and energetic mind, with talents
of a very superior order, she soon began to take great delight in study,
and was ambitious to excel in every thing that she undertook.&nbsp;
Drawing she pursued with intense eagerness, and in this and other acquirements,
she made great proficiency.&nbsp; Until about the age of seventeen,
her highest enjoyment was derived from the cultivation of the intellectual
powers, and in the endeavour to raise these to their highest <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>perfection,
she imagined the greatest happiness to consist.&nbsp; In her journal
she writes:&mdash;&ldquo;My thoughts have been this week, one continued
castle in the air of being an artist; the only reality they were built
on, was my having painted in oils better than I thought I could, and
a feeling that I shall in a little time succeed, and an unbounded ambition
to do so.&nbsp; I have had many arguments with myself, to know if it
would be right.&nbsp; I think it would, if I could make good use of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But gradually she found that no object which had this world for its
limit, could satisfy the cravings of an immortal soul.&nbsp; She began
to feel that she was formed for higher purposes than the gratification
of self in its most refined and plausible form, and in 1806, we note
the gradual unfolding of that change of view, which through the operation
of the Holy Spirit, led her to the unreserved surrender of her whole
being to the service of her Lord;&mdash;a surrender that in so remarkable
a manner marked her unwavering path through the remaining portion of
her dedicated life.&nbsp; Speaking of this period, after her first attendance
of the Yearly Meeting, she says,&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>July,
1806.&nbsp; &ldquo;This time, for almost the first in my life, I seem
come to a stand in the objects of my darling pursuits, which I may say
have been almost entirely the pursuit of pleasure, through the medium
of the understanding.&nbsp; This I feel must be a useless search, for
the further I go, the more unattainable is the contentment which I hoped
a degree of excellence might have produced;&mdash;the further I go,
the further does my idea of perfection extend; therefore this way of
attaining happiness I find is impossible.&nbsp; Never in my life was
I so sensible of the real weakness of man, though to all appearance
so strong; for I am persuaded that it is almost impossible to conduct
oneself through this world, without being sincerely religious.&nbsp;
The human mind must have an object, and let that object be the attainment
of eternal happiness. * * * After such considerations, can I be so weak
as not to make religion my only pursuit?&nbsp; That which will, I believe,
bring my mind into beautiful order, and, rendering all worldly objects
subservient to its use, harmonize the whole, and fit it to bear fruit
to all eternity, and the fruit of righteousness is peace.&nbsp; I have
felt my mind very much softened <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>of
late, and more and more see the beauty of holiness, but all the progress
I can say that I have made towards it, is in loving it more;&mdash;yet
I feel I have a great way to go before my heart is entirely given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feb. 9th, 1807.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day I am twenty; let me endeavour
to describe with sincerity what twenty years have effected upon me;
how difficult self-love and blindness make answering the questions,
What am I?&nbsp; How far am I advanced in the great end of being, the
making such use of my time here, that it may bear fruit when time with
me is over?&nbsp; When I look upon myself with the greatest seriousness,
how ill do I think of myself!&nbsp; I see myself endowed with powers,
which I often, (I hope, with a pure and unfeigned heart,) wish may be
applied aright.&nbsp; But in my mind, what strong &lsquo;bulls of Bashan&rsquo;
compass me about!&nbsp; What I fear most, and that which sometimes comes
upon me most awfully, is, that my will is not properly brought into
subjection. * * * Often when clothed with something of heavenly love,
do I feel that I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God,
than dwell in king&rsquo;s palaces, but I fear the general tendency
of my pursuits would make <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>me
more fit for the latter than the former.&nbsp; What I want and do most
sincerely wish for, is, that I may be truly humble, and that where pride
now reigns, humility may prevail; and where ambition, contentment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1808, the death of a favourite first cousin appears to have been
the means of greatly deepening her serious impressions, and of increasing
the desire to &ldquo;relieve herself,&rdquo; as she expresses it, &ldquo;from
the miserable state of inconsistency in which a gay Friend is situated.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A short time subsequent to this period, she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>May, 1808.&nbsp; &ldquo;With my father and mother I left the Grove
this morning, with a mind much softened, though not afflicted by parting
with those I love, earnestly wishing that what I was going to attend,&mdash;the
Yearly Meeting, might stamp more deeply the impressions I had received.&nbsp;
We reached Epping that night.&nbsp; I felt very serious; Love seemed
to have smitten me, and under that banner, I earnestly hoped that I
might be enabled to partake of whatever might be set before me in the
banqueting house.&nbsp; I saw that it would be right for me to say <i>thee</i>,
and <i>thou</i>, to everybody, and I begged that I might be so kept
in love as to be <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>enabled
to do it,&mdash;that love might draw me, not fear terrify me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deeply I felt to enjoy First-day, and was strengthened
at meeting.&nbsp; For the first time, to-day I called the days of the
week numerically, on principle, it cost me at first a blush.&nbsp; This
day has afforded me deeper and sweeter feelings than any I have yet
passed; surprise and ridicule I have felt to be useful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left Bury Hill early: I can look back to the time I have spent
here as the happiest in my life; and I have earnestly wished that my
example and influence in future life, may be useful to those whom, never
before my mind was so altered, did I love with so sweet or so great
an affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After alluding to some further change, she writes; &ldquo;I felt
increasingly the weight of advocating the cause I have engaged in; oh!
may no word or action of mine, stain the character I am assuming, and
may no self-exaltation be the consequence: the mind, I feel, must be
kept deep indeed, to avoid the rocks that do every where surround.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6th Month, 1808.&nbsp; &ldquo;Went to meeting&mdash;thought that
by observing the commandment, and confessing <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Christ
before men, we should only be showing the beautiful effect of obedience,
in the fruit of the Spirit it produces,&mdash;that it does not consist
in speech, dress, or behaviour, but that by being obedient in these
and all things, to the law written in our hearts; we should be overshadowed
by that sweetness and quietness of spirit, the fruits of which would
prove whose government we are under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7th Month, 1808, Cromer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Walked on the shore, the sky
was illuminated by the setting sun the scene was of nature&rsquo;s greatest
beauty, I could not speak, but it was not the effect of the scene.&nbsp;
Such scenes in which I used to revel, have lost much of their influence
in the inferior peace they bring, to that which a few small sacrifices,
the effect of obedience, produce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grove, 11th Month, 1808.&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience tried, and censoriousness
of mind and some words allowed to have too much dominion.&nbsp; The
higher we rise, the more we feel the foibles of others; and then the
more need have we of the spirit of love and charity, to be patient with
them; and if we are not, it is not excellence, but only the sight of
it we have gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12th Month, 1808.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear I have not sufficiently <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>this
week, wrestled for the blessing of peace.&nbsp; I am sensible of having
the power of pleasing, of having stronger natural powers and more acquirements
than most women,&mdash;I am conscious too, of having with all my might,
sought that which is highest, and that my heart has been made willing
to sacrifice all for the attainment of it, and wonders have I already
known; if I do not now diligently seek that which can make me feelingly
ascribe all the glory, where alone it is due, fruitless must all my
talents be, and great my fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12th Month, 12th, 1808.&nbsp; &ldquo;--- came, the conversation in
the evening, softened my heart in the deduction I drew from it, of what
a prize was our possession,&mdash;how anchorless the world seemed to
be,&mdash;and I loved dear Friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd Month, 9th, 1809.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty-two years old.&nbsp; Through
the mercy of everlasting kindness, great is the change that this year
has wrought in me; the power of Love has enticed me to begin that spiritual
journey which leads to the promised land: I have left, by His guidance
and strength, the bondage of Egypt, and have seen His wonders in the
deep.&nbsp; May the endeavour of my life be, to keep close to that Angel,
who can deliver us <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>through
the trials and dangers of the wilderness of this world.</p>
<p>I have not studied much this year, yet I have almost every day read
a little, and never was my sight so clear into the intellectual world.&nbsp;
The works of the head may, I believe, usefully occupy such portions
of time as are not necessary for discharging our relationship in society.
* * * But above all things be humble, which a love of all perfection
is, I believe, not only consistent with, but the root of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1811, Hannah C. Gurney married Jonathan Backhouse, and settled
at Darlington.&nbsp; The early years of her married life appear to have
been much devoted to her young family.&nbsp; For a time, her journal
was entirely suspended; but in 1815 she writes: &ldquo;These last four
years, are perhaps best left in that situation, in which spiritual darkness
has in a great measure involved them; it may be the sweet and new objects
of external love, and necessary attention in which I have been engaged,
have too much drawn my mind from internal watchfulness, after the first
flow of spiritual joy began to subside; or it has been the will of the
Author of all blessing to change the dispensation, <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>and
taking from me the light of his love, in which all beauty so easily
and naturally exists, to teach me indeed, that the glory of all good
belongs to Him alone, and that He is jealous of our decking ourselves
with His jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1820, she first spoke as a minister, in reference to which she
writes: 3rd Month, 1820, &ldquo;Had felt for some time, and particularly
lately, a warm concern for the interest of our family, which to my humiliation,
surprise, and consolation, I was strengthened to express to them in
a private opportunity, before I left Sunderland.&nbsp; On our ride home,
I felt the candle of the Lord shine round about me, in a manner I had
not done for years, accompanied with much tenderness and some foreboding
fears.&nbsp; I felt I had put my hand to the plough, and I must not
turn back, but I remembered the days that were past, and I knew something
of the power of Him in whom I had believed; though fear often compassed
me about, and too much imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1820.&nbsp; &ldquo;My heart has burned as an oven, internal and external
supplication has not been wanting to ease it; may I endure the burnings
as I ought.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speaking of attending the Yearly <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Meeting
soon after, she says: &ldquo;I saw many dangerous enemies of my own
heart near me, yet was there mercifully preserved a germ of truth, in
which met the hearts of the faithful, and which was an encouragement
to me; I afterwards spoke twice in the Yearly Meeting, and the composure
at the moment, and after a time the peace that ensued, seemed to assure
me that I had not run without being sent.&nbsp; The remembrance of former
days came strongly before me, and in thus again publicly manifesting
the intent of my heart, I felt the comfort of being no stranger to that
Hand, which, as it once fed me with milk, seemed to me now after a long
night season, feeding me with meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her return home, she writes: &ldquo;Opened my mouth in Darlington
meeting, on First-day afternoon.&nbsp; A mountain in prospect!&nbsp;
The meetings now became very interesting to me, and as the reward of
what I was induced to believe was faithfulness, often greatly refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of this year, she lost her eldest son, a child of great
promise, and the suffering attendant upon this deep sorrow, in addition
to <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>close
mental baptism, at times greatly prostrated her physical powers.</p>
<p>11th Month 4th, 1820, we find the following-memorandum: &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh
how great is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear
Thee, which Thou hast wrought for them that trust in Thee before the
sons of men.&rsquo;&nbsp; In looking back to the last two or three months,
I feel I may adopt this language: in them I have known the greatest
portion of suffering that it has yet been my lot to taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd Month, 1822.&nbsp; She writes, &ldquo;In the afternoon meeting,
a subject seemed so clear before me, that I ventured to speak; but oh!
the evil of my heart, the consciousness of having, or supposing I had,
chosen my words well, was like the fly in the ointment of the apothecary,
the baneful effects of which, I felt many days after.&nbsp; The more
I see of my own mind, the more may the breathing of my soul be,&mdash;&lsquo;If
Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sometimes to believe
that it is His will, is sweet to me, but we must maintain the fight,
for though the victory is His, the fall is ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The constant and deep consideration for <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>others
in the most minute actions of life, how I love it, and feel myself &lsquo;as
a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>5th Month, 6th, 1822.&nbsp; &ldquo;Days and nights of much spiritual
conflict, or rather perhaps the sight that there was much to conflict
with; weak in body and weak in mind!&nbsp; In my ministry more patient
and deep deliberation wanting.&nbsp; Last night, believed I had not
kept close enough to my Guide in prayer, with which I felt some distress,&mdash;perhaps
not altogether wrong,&mdash;but had not stopped when I ought, nor waited
at every moment for clearness and strength in the exercise; I hope I
shall not hurt others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6th Month, 1822.&nbsp; &ldquo;A month is now passed in which I have
been sweetly enabled to enjoy the love of God in my heart.&nbsp; I trust
we shall experience preservation, though we may well fear for ourselves,
and be the subject of fear for others.&nbsp; Oh! that, without affectation,
we may live deeply in the root of life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th Month, 1823.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have much to bind me to this earth,
but perhaps more power of gratefully enjoying its blessings is wanted,
and may be in store for me before I leave it; some minds <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>seem
deeply anchored in the truth, meekly and patiently bearing the trials
of the day, with firmer faith and greater purity, but each heart alone
knows its own bitterness, and I believe there is never much attainment
without much suffering;&mdash;a chastened habit of thought, how desirable
to be the habit of early life! riches and indulgences how inimical to
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th Month, 1825.&nbsp; &ldquo;My mind enjoyed a liberty, and something
of the light of the glorious gospel, a state which I often pant after,
and am so generally a stranger to; in each day a religious engagement
seemed peculiarly blessed to myself.&nbsp; A sense of being liked and
loved, is gratifying; at the same time I acknowledge, it has its dangers;
it is, however, a stimulus to do good and to communicate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th Month, 25th.&nbsp; &ldquo;A poor body, and a weak restless mind!&nbsp;
How the sword does wear the scabbard! but this world is not to be our
paradise; perhaps I lose some little strength in striving to make it
so.&nbsp; Oh! my God, have pity upon me; thou alone canst know how much
I suffer;&mdash;if my children ail anything, what it costs me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1826, she visited the families of Friends in <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Darlington
Monthly Meeting, in company with Isaac Stephenson; and in allusion to
this engagement, she writes: &ldquo;Entered last week on a visit, with
I. Stephenson, to the families of this Monthly Meeting.&nbsp; Ministry
is surely a gift! may the vessel be purified by using it in faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd Month, 1826.&nbsp; &ldquo;After many cogitations and some provings
of faith, I went with Isaac Stephenson to Manchester, Lancaster, and
Leeds: I felt it like leaving all to follow what I believed to be my
divine Guide; it cost me some heart-sinkings and tears, but my mind
was sweetly preserved in peace and confidence; and, though I had times
of depression and fear to pass through, I have been thankful that I
made the sacrifice.&nbsp; It has endeared me to many individuals; and
at times, in the undoubted belief that it was a divine requiring, it
has strengthened my faith, and excited some degree of thankfulness for
being so employed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th Month, 16th.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sweet day of rest and peace, such
as I do not remember to have known for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th Month, 18th.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monthly Meeting one of perplexity and
fear, Oh! for dwelling deep and <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>lying
low! and waiting in quietness for the &lsquo;little cloud!&rsquo; but
it seems as if my faith were to be tried by things coming unexpectedly
upon me, and to be humbled by feeling ill prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time she went on advancing rapidly in the work of the ministry:
her truly catholic spirit expanded in love to her fellow-creatures;
the inmates of the palace as well as those of the prison, shared alike
her Christian zeal and interest.&nbsp; Her naturally powerful and refined
mind, deeply instructed in the things of God, rendered her peculiarly
fitted to labour amongst those, who being invested with wealth and influence,
she regarded as stewards, deeply responsible for the right occupation
of their various gifts: with many of these, in the upper classes of
society, she sought and obtained opportunities for conveying religious
counsel; and in not a few instances there was a deep response in the
hearts of her hearers, to the truths which she had to proclaim.</p>
<p>The public meetings which she held were very numerous,&mdash;many
of them very remarkable.&nbsp; Her fervour in seeking to arouse to a
sense of their condition, those who were &ldquo;dead in trespasses and
sins,&rdquo;&mdash;her sound and convincing arguments, <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>in
controverting the views of the infidel,&mdash;her zeal against the lukewarm
professor, and her earnest affectionate invitations to the humble believer
in Jesus, to &ldquo;lay aside every weight,&rdquo; and partake, in all
their fulness, of the blessings purchased for them by the dear Son of
God; will long be remembered by those who felt the truth and unction
of her appeals.&nbsp; She dwelt upon the glorious scheme of redemption,
through the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ Jesus upon the cross, for
the sins of the whole world; and of the absolute necessity of sanctification
of spirit, through the effectual operation of divine grace on the heart,
as one, who had herself largely participated, in the blessings and mercies
of her God.&nbsp; She was, however, no stranger to deep mental conflicts,
both in the prosecution of her religious labours, and in the more retired
sphere of domestic life, as some of her memoranda show.</p>
<p>In 1827, after visiting with her husband, the counties of Devon and
Cornwall, an engagement which occupied them nearly two months, and included
a visit to the Scilly Isles, she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>7th Month, 1827.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt it a day of favour when we gave
in our account at the Monthly Meeting, <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the
third day after our arrival at home, but in returning from this journey,
I have been made remarkably sensible, that the business of religion
is the business of the day, and that the exercises and strength of any
past day, are but as nothing for the day that is passing over us; and
many of these days have been passed in much mental conflict, and much
bodily weakness and languor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1828.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many, and many have been my fears, lest the good
things that others may see us surrounded with, should be as a stumbling
block leading to covetousness; how hardly shall they that have riches
lead the life of a humble follower of the dear Redeemer!&nbsp; These
thoughts often beset me, and sometimes make me fear, if ever I have
a right to open my mouth to advocate His cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wish I had a heart, a head, and a mind fit for all
I could embrace, but that may never be: however, altogether my mind
has been of late, less covered with clouds than it used to be, and my
health revives with it.&nbsp; &lsquo;What shall I render for all thy
benefits?&rsquo; may well be the language of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1829 she was again joined by her dear <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>husband
in a visit to Ireland; after which she writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>10th Month, 1829.&nbsp; &ldquo;We passed through many deep baptisms,
many sinks both of body and mind, and in the course of three or four
months, attended all the particular meetings; I think we did too much
in the time to do it as well as we might; there was much exercise of
faith, but patience had not its perfect work:&mdash;may my daily prayer
be for patience, and the daily close exercise of my spirit to obtain
it; for want of it, I get into many perplexities, that might be avoided;
yet with all the omissions and commissions that I can look back upon
with shame, I can number this journey among the many mercies of my life,
being at times in it, introduced into a more soul-satisfying state than
I had perhaps ever known before, and I was never more fully persuaded
that we were commissioned to preach the gospel.&nbsp; The company of
my dear husband was truly a comfort and support, as well as very endearing,
and this journey has enlarged my heart in love to hundreds, and has
written many epistles there, which I trust may never be blotted out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1830, she laid before her Monthly Meeting, <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>a
prospect of going to America.&nbsp; This concern was cordially united
with, and she and her husband were liberated for the service in that
land.&nbsp; In reference to this very weighty engagement, she thus writes
to her dear cousin, Elizabeth Fry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Darlington, 2nd Month, 4th, 1830.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Betsy,</p>
<p>I believe some of thy tenderest sympathies will be aroused, on hearing
of the momentous prospect now before us of visiting North America.&nbsp;
I dare say many, many years ago, thy imagination sent me there,&mdash;call
it by that name, or the more orthodox one of faith,&mdash;so has mine,
but I saw it without baptism; now, I pass into it under baptism, which
in depth far exceeds any thing I have known before; the severing work
it is to the ties of nature, to my dear Father, Mother, and Children,
breaks me all to pieces, but I have much, if not entirely, been spared
from doubts; all I seem to have had to do was to submit; this is a great
comfort, for which I desire to be thankful, and for that peace which
in the midst of deep suffering has so far rested upon it.</p>
<p>Thy very affectionate<br />
<span class="smcap">H. C. Backhouse</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Her
labours in America were very abundant, and there is reason to believe,
blessed to very many.&nbsp; During the five years she spent on that
Continent, she visited the greater part of the meetings of Friends,
and in doing so, shrank from no hardship or privation consequent upon
travelling in districts recently settled.</p>
<p>In 1833, Jonathan Backhouse thus writes of her labours&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think my wife&rsquo;s labours in these parts, have been
of essential service;&mdash;helped some sunken ones out of a pit, strengthened
some weak hands, and confirmed some wavering ones, as well as comforted
the mourners.&nbsp; She has no cause to be discouraged about her labours,
they have been blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband thinking it desirable to return for a while to England,
Hannah C. Backhouse was provided with a most faithful valuable companion
in Eliza P. Kirkbride, and for her as well as for many other beloved
friends to whom she had become closely united in America, she retained
a warm interest and affection to the close of her life.</p>
<p>In 1835, they returned to England, and in the <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>bosom
of her beloved family and friends, great was, for a time, her domestic
happiness.&nbsp; But home endearments were not permitted to interfere
with her devotion to Him, to do whose will, was not only her highest
aim, but her chief delight: and whenever the Lord&rsquo;s call was heard,
she was ready to obey.&nbsp; Many parts of England, and Scotland were
visited between this time and 1845.&nbsp; During this interval some
of her nearest domestic ties were broken; her eldest surviving son,
an engaging youth of seventeen, her beloved husband, and a precious
daughter, the wife of John Hodgkin, of Tottenham, were all summoned
to their eternal home: whilst under the pressure of sorrow occasioned
by the removal of Ann Hodgkin, the following letter was penned:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Tottenham, 12th Month, 9th, 1845.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My losses have been many and great, but the greatness of this,
I am increasingly coming into the apprehension of.&nbsp; She was lovely
in her life, and in death may we not be divided! or <i>by</i> death,
but may her sweet spirit be very near in my remembrance, to the end
of my days, and then may I join Father and Mother, Brothers and Sisters,
Husband and Children,&mdash;how many <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>of
the nearest ties now, we trust, in heaven, and how few on earth comparatively.&nbsp;
On this subject I cannot now dwell,&mdash;when I can view her free from
all weakness, corruption, and suffering, in the enjoyment of <i>that</i>
rest, she knew so well how to appreciate, I could smile with a joyful
sorrow; but few of such moments have been given; in general a patient
bearing of the present moment, is the most we have arrived at, under
the blessed unmoved confidence that all is well.</p>
<p>Your very affectionate sister,<br />
<span class="smcap">H. C. Backhouse</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this time a cessation from labour was granted, and after having
thus devoted the meridian of her life to the service of her Lord, she
was permitted for some years previous to her decease, to enjoy a season
of almost uninterrupted repose.&nbsp; Love, meekness, gentleness, and
peace were eminently the clothing of her spirit; and like Moses viewing
from the Mount the Promised Land, she seemed almost to live above the
trials and temptations of time; nothing appeared materially to disturb
or ruffle the repose of her soul, deeply centred in God.&nbsp; Her ministry
was often <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>strikingly
beautiful and impressive, especially exhorting to unreserved dedication,
and dwelling on the glories of the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p>During the latter part of 1849, her health, which had long been delicate,
began increasingly to give way; at the end of the 3rd Month of 1850,
she was seized with alarming illness, from which little hope was entertained
of her recovery; from this she so far rallied as to leave her bed-room,
and go into an adjoining sitting-room, but never was able to go down
stairs.&nbsp; It was evident her strength was very small, but no immediate
danger was at this time apprehended.&nbsp; She was at times, cheerful,
always tranquil and full of repose, and able to enjoy the company of
those immediately around her; at other times illness oppressed her,
and prevented the power for much exertion of mind or communication of
thought.&nbsp; But words were not needed to declare her faith or her
love, when through having faithfully occupied with the grace that had
been given to her, her whole life might almost be said to have been
one act of dedication to God.</p>
<p>On the night of the 5th of Fifth Month, increased illness came on,
she continued conscious almost to <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the
last, and alluded with perfect calmness to the fresh symptoms of danger.&nbsp;
On her sister remarking to her, that &ldquo;though it was a dark valley,
it would soon be all joy to her,&rdquo; she responded by a beautiful
smile, but power of articulation soon failed, and on the morning of
the 6th of Fifth Month, 1850, she most gently expired.</p>
<p>We cannot close this account more appropriately than in the language
of a dear friend who had long known and loved her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A character of such rare excellence, such singleness of purpose,
such true devotedness, in which the intellectual and the spiritual were
so well balanced, and well developed together:&mdash;a character in
which, with all the occasional undulations and agitations of the surface,
there was such a deep, such a clear, such a calm and steady under-current
of sterling piety, of unwavering attachment to the cause of our God
and of his Christ, of close adherence to the leadings of his Spirit,
and strong desire to do his will;&mdash;a character in which the woman,
the Christian, and the Quaker were so fused into one, did truly adorn
the doctrine of God her Saviour.&nbsp; It was conspicuous that by the
grace of God she was what <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>she
was; though nature had done much, grace had done much more, and it was
evident that she humbly felt that she was not her own, that she was
bought with a price; that amidst all that surrounded her of the perishing
things of time, she did not live unto herself, but unto Him who died
for her and rose again, who was her Alpha and Omega, her all in all.&nbsp;
In our little and afflicted church, the loss is great: she was one of
our stakes, and one of our cords!&nbsp; The stake is removed, the cord
is broken, but our God abideth for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>A
SKETCH OF THE LIFE AND LABOURS OF PATRICK,<br />
The Apostle of the Irish.</h3>
<p>We think it will be agreeable to our readers, that we should occupy
a few vacant pages, by the following lively particulars respecting &ldquo;Patrick,
the Apostle of the Irish.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are extracted from a work
lately published, under the title of, &ldquo;Light in Dark Places; or
Memorials of Christian Life in the Middle Ages,&rdquo; which is stated,
in the preface, to be translated from a German work by the late Augustus
Neander.&nbsp; Patrick flourished in the early part of the fifth century,
before the Romish yoke was imposed upon the British churches, but not
before much superstition had become mixed with the purity of the Christian
faith.</p>
<p><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>His
early circumstances seem, however, to have entirely detached him from
dependence upon man, and to have driven him to the One great Source
of light and strength.&nbsp; Romanists have a story of his having gone
to Rome, and having received there his authority as the first bishop
of Ireland; but it is evident that his <i>call</i> to preach the gospel
to the Irish, was not of man, or from man, but immediately from God,
who inspired him with holy faith and courage, and in a most remarkable
manner prospered his labours.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>This remarkable man was prepared, by very peculiar circumstances,
for his important work; and in his instance, also, it may be seen, how
that infinite wisdom which guides the development of the kingdom of
God amongst men, is able to bring great things out of what seems insignificant
to the eyes of men.</p>
<p>Patrick, called in his native tongue Succath, was born <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
372, between the Scottish towns of Dumbarton and Glasgow, (then appended
to England,) in the village of Bonaven, since named in honour of him,
Kilpatrick.&nbsp; He was the son of a poor unlettered deacon of the
village church.&nbsp; <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>No
particular care was bestowed on his education, and he lived on light-heartedly,
from day to day, without making the religious truths taught him by his
parents matters of personal interest, until his seventeenth year.</p>
<p>Then, it happened that he was awakened by a severe chastisement from
his Heavenly Father from this sleep of death to a higher life.&nbsp;
Some pirates of the wild tribe of the Scots, who then inhabited Ireland,
landed at the dwelling-place of Patrick, and carried him off with other
captives.&nbsp; He was sold into slavery to a Scottish prince, who committed
to him the care of his flocks and herds.&nbsp; Necessity directed his
heart to that God of whom, in his days of rest in his father&rsquo;s
house, he had not thought.&nbsp; Abandoned of men, he found consolation
and blessedness in Him, and now first learned to perceive and enjoy
the treasures which the Christian has in heaven.&nbsp; Whilst he roamed
about with his flocks, through ice and snow, communion with his God
in prayer, and quiet contemplation, were his portion.&nbsp; Let us hear
how he himself, in a confession which he subsequently wrote, describes
this change which took place in him.</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>&ldquo;I
was about sixteen years old, and knew nothing of the true God, when
I was led into captivity with many thousands of my countrymen, as we
deserved, in that we had departed from God, and had not kept his commandments.&nbsp;
There God opened my unbelieving heart, so that I, although late, remembered
my sins, and turned with my whole heart to the Lord my God, to Him who
had regarded my loneliness, had had compassion on my youth and my ignorance,
and had watched over me before I knew him; who, ere I knew how to choose
between good and evil, had guarded and cherished me, as a father doth
his son.&nbsp; This I know assuredly, that before God humbled me, I
was like a stone lying sunk in deep mire; but He who is able came, He
raised me in his mercy, and set me on a very high place.&nbsp; Therefore
must I loudly bear witness to this, in order, in some measure, to repay
the Lord for such great blessings in time and eternity, great beyond
the apprehension of human reason.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I came to Ireland,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;and used daily to keep the cattle, and often every day
to pray, the fear and the love of God were ever more and more enkindled
in me, and my faith increased, so <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>that,
in one day, I spoke a hundred times in prayer, and in the night almost
as often; and even when I passed the night on the mountains, or in the
forest, amid snow and ice and rain, I would awake before daybreak to
pray.&nbsp; And I felt no discomfort, there was then no sloth in me,
such as I find in my heart now, for then the Spirit glowed within me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had passed six years in the service of this prince, he thought
he heard a voice in his sleep which promised him a speedy return to
his native land, and soon afterwards announced to him that a ship was
already prepared to take him.&nbsp; In reliance on this call, he set
out, and after a journey of many days, he found a ship about to set
sail.&nbsp; But the captain would not, at first, receive the poor unknown
youth.&nbsp; Patrick fell on his knees and prayed.&nbsp; He had not
finished his prayer before one of the ship&rsquo;s company called him
back, and offered him a passage.&nbsp; After a wearisome voyage, in
which he experienced, from the grace which guided him, many a deliverance
from great peril, and many a memorable answer to prayer, he arrived
once more amongst his people.</p>
<p>Many years after this, he was again carried off <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>by
pirates.&nbsp; But, in sixteen days, by the special guidance of Providence,
he regained his freedom, and again returned, after many fresh perils
and fatigues, to his people.&nbsp; Great was the joy of his parents
to see their son again after so many perils, and they entreated him
thenceforth to remain with them always.&nbsp; But Patrick felt an irresistible
call to carry to the people amongst whom he had passed the years of
his youth, and amongst whom he had been born again to the heavenly life,
the tidings of that salvation which had been imparted to him by Divine
grace, whilst amongst them.&nbsp; As the apostle Paul was by the Lord
called, in a nocturnal vision, to carry to the people of Macedonia the
first tidings of salvation, so there appeared to Patrick one night,
in a vision, a man from Ireland with many letters.&nbsp; He gave him
one, and Patrick read the first words, &ldquo;The words of the Irish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as he read these words, he thought he heard the simultaneous cry
of many Irish tribes dwelling by the sea, &ldquo;We pray thee, child
of God, come and dwell once more amongst us.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not
read further, from the agitation of his heart, and awoke.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Another
night he thought he heard in a dream a heavenly voice, whose last words
only were intelligible to him, namely, these words,&mdash;&ldquo;He
who gave his life for thee, speaks in thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he awoke
full of joy.&nbsp; One night it seemed to him as if something that was
in him, and yet above him, and was not himself, prayed with deep sighings,
and at the end of the prayer it spoke, as if it were the Spirit of God
himself.&nbsp; And he awoke, and remembered the expressive words of
the apostle Paul, concerning the inward communion of the children of
God with his Spirit, &ldquo;The Spirit itself helpeth our infirmities.&nbsp;
For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit
itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in Romans viii.&nbsp; 24 &ldquo;Christ which also maketh intercession
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Almighty Shepherd of souls does not draw all to himself by
the same means, nor guide and nourish them alike; but, on the contrary
reveals and communicates himself to them in divers manners, according
to his various purposes for them, and their various wants; it pleased
Him to grant Patrick, by many manifestations of his grace, the pledge
of the certainty of his fellowship <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>with
Himself, and of his call to preach the Gospel in Ireland.&nbsp; His
parents and friends sought to hold him back, representing to him that
such an undertaking far exceeded his capacity.&nbsp; He himself informs
us of this, when he says: &ldquo;Many dissuaded me from this journey,
and said behind my back, &lsquo;Why does this man throw himself into
danger, amongst the heathen who do not know the Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was not said maliciously, but they could not comprehend the thing on
account of my rustic life and manners.&rdquo;&nbsp; But nothing could
mislead him, for he trusted in the power of the Lord, who imparted to
him the inward confidence that He had called him, and was with him.&nbsp;
He himself says of this: &ldquo;Whence came to me so great and blessed
a gift, that I should know and love God, and be able to forsake my country
and my kindred, although large gifts were offered me, with many tears,
if I would remain?&nbsp; And against my will I was compelled to offend
many of my kindred and my well-wishers.&nbsp; But by God&rsquo;s guidance,
I yielded not to them; it was not my own power, it was God who triumphed
in me, and resisted them all, so that I went amongst the people of Ireland
to preach <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>to
them this Gospel, prepared to suffer much contempt from the unbelieving,
and many persecutions, even to chains; and, if needful, to sacrifice
my freedom for the good of others.&nbsp; And if I am counted worthy,
I am ready also to lay down my life with joy for His name&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patrick, accordingly, went to Ireland, in the year 431.&nbsp; He
could now make use of his early proficiency in the Irish language.&nbsp;
He gathered great multitudes of the people together in the open air,
by beat of drum, to tell them of the sufferings of the Saviour for sinful
men; and the doctrine of the cross manifested its characteristic power
over many hearts.&nbsp; Patrick met indeed with much opposition.&nbsp;
The priests and national bards, who possessed great influence, excited
the people against him, and he had to endure many a hot persecution.&nbsp;
But he overcame by his steadfastness in the faith, by his fervent zeal,
and by a love which drew all hearts to itself.&nbsp; Patrick addressed
himself especially to the chiefs and princes of the people.&nbsp; They
could do the most mischief, if they were excited by the Druids against
the strange religion; and, on the other hand, if they received the Gospel,
they might <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>make
their people more accessible, and form a counterbalance to the influence
of the Druids.</p>
<p>Patrick took the part of servants who had suffered hard usage from
their masters.&nbsp; When he found youths of the lower ranks, who seemed
to him fitted for a higher calling, he provided for their education,
and trained them to be teachers of the people.</p>
<p>He had, from his youth, as we have seen, experienced the especial
guidance of the Lord, and his heart was penetrated by it.&nbsp; Now,
whilst he laboured in the fervour and power of faith, he was able to
produce effects on the rude minds of the Irish, such as never could
have been produced by ordinary human power.&nbsp; He saw himself, moreover,
sustained by the peculiar direction of that God whose word he preached.&nbsp;
Patrick speaks of it, not in spiritual pride, but full of the sense
of his unworthiness and impotence, as well as of the consciousness of
the grace working in and through him.</p>
<p>After speaking, in one of his letters, of such marvels as God granted
him to perform amongst the barbarous people, he added: &ldquo;But I
conjure all, let no one, on account of these or the like <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>things,
think to place me on an equality with the Apostles and other perfect
men; for I am an insignificant, sinful, and despicable man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And more marvellous to him than the miracles which were wrought by him,
was the simple fact which filled his whole soul, that by him who, until
God drew his soul to Himself by severe chastisement, had himself cared
so little about his own salvation, many thousands of the people, who
had hitherto known nothing of the true God, should be brought to salvation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Marvel,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;ye who fear God, small and great,
and ye eloquent talkers, who know nothing of the Lord, inquire and acknowledge
who it is that has awakened me, a simple man, from the midst of those
who are accounted wise, learned, and mighty, in word and in deed.&nbsp;
For I, who was abandoned beyond many others in the world; even I, in
spite of all this, have been called by his Spirit, that in fear and
trembling, yet faithfully and blamelessly, I should serve the people
to whom the love of Christ has led me.&nbsp; Unweariedly must I thank
my God, who has kept me faithful in the day of temptation, so that I
can this day trustfully offer my soul as a living sacrifice of thanksgiving
to my <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Lord
Christ, who has delivered me out of all my afflictions, so that I must
also say, Who am I, Lord? and what is my calling? that thou hast so
gloriously revealed to me thy Godhead, that I can now constantly rejoice
amongst the heathen, and glorify Thy name wherever I may be, not only
in prosperity, but also in adversity; so that whatever may befall me,
good or evil, I can calmly receive it, and continually thank that God
who has taught me to believe in Him as the only true God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patrick endeavoured to avoid all appearance of seeking his own gain
or glory.&nbsp; A man who, according to the judgment of men, was not
fitted to effect such great things, who from obscurity and poverty had
been called to so high a place, and in whom therefore, as is frequently
the case, those who had formerly known him after the flesh would not
recognise what the Spirit had accomplished, such a man was obliged,
with all the more circumspection, to avoid giving any occasion to those
who were disposed to declare a thing which they could neither measure
nor comprehend by the common standard, altogether beyond flesh and blood.&nbsp;
When many, full of love and gratitude to the teacher of <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>salvation,
their spiritual father, freely offered him gifts, and pious women offered
their ornaments, Patrick, although the donors were at first offended
at it, in order to avoid all evil report, declined everything.&nbsp;
He himself gave presents to the heathen chiefs, in order thereby to
purchase peace for himself and his churches; he ransomed many Christians
from captivity; and was himself prepared, as a good shepherd, to lay
down all, even to his life, for his sheep.&nbsp; In his confession of
faith, which, after labouring for thirty years in this calling, he addressed
to his converts, he says: &ldquo;That ye may rejoice in me, and I may
ever rejoice in you in the Lord, I repent not what I have done, and
even now it is not enough for me, I shall go further and sacrifice much
more.&nbsp; The Lord is mighty to confirm me yet more, that I may yield
up my life for your souls.&nbsp; I call God to witness in my soul, that
I have not written this to seek glory from you.&nbsp; The glory which
is not seen, but believed on in the heart is enough for me.&nbsp; Faithful
is that God who hath promised, and he lieth not.&nbsp; But already in
this world I behold myself exalted above measure by the Lord.&nbsp;
I know very well that poverty and hardship suit me <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>better
than wealth and ease; yea, even the Lord Christ became poor for our
sakes.&nbsp; Daily have I expected to be seized, carried into captivity,
or slain; but I fear none of these things, because of the promises of
heaven; for I have cast myself into the arms of the Almighty God, who
reigns everywhere, as it is said in the Psalm, &lsquo;Cast thy burden
upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now I commend
my soul to my faithful God, whom in my insignificance I serve as his
messenger.&nbsp; For since with Him there is no respect of persons,
and since He has chosen me for this calling, that I as one of the least
of His people, should serve Him, what shall I render unto the Lord for
all his benefits?&nbsp; What shall I say or promise unto my Lord?&nbsp;
For I can do nothing, unless He himself give it me!&nbsp; But He trieth
the hearts and reins, and He knoweth how greatly I long that He may
give me to drink of the cup of His sufferings, as He has granted to
others who love Him.&nbsp; I pray God that He may give me perseverance,
and enable me to bear a faithful witness until my departure.&nbsp; And
if I have striven after anything good for my God&rsquo;s sake, whom
I love, I beseech Him that I, with those my new converts who have <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>fallen
into captivity, may shed my blood for his Name&rsquo;s sake, even though
I should never be buried, even though my body should be torn in pieces
by wild beasts.&nbsp; I believe firmly that if this should befall me,
I should gain my body as well as my soul; for undoubtedly, in that day,
we shall arise and shine like the sun, that is, in the glory of our
Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who is the Son of the living God, as joint heirs
with Christ, renewed in His image; for by Him, through Him, and with
Him shall we reign.&nbsp; That sun which we see, rises daily for us
by God&rsquo;s command; but it will never reign, and its brightness
will not last for ever.&nbsp; All those also who worship it will (unhappy
ones!) draw down punishment on themselves.&nbsp; But we pray in faith
to Christ, the <i>true Sun</i>, that will never set, and he also who
doeth His will shall never set, but shall live for ever, as Christ lives
for ever, and reigns with God, the Almighty Father, and the Holy Spirit,
from everlasting to everlasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patrick would gladly, after the absence and labours of many years,
have once more visited his relations and his old friends in his native
Britain and in Gaul, but he sacrificed his inclination to the <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>higher
calling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would gladly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have journeyed
to my fatherland and my parents, and also once more have visited my
brethren in Gaul, that I might have seen again the countenances of the
saints of my Lord; God knows I longed for it much, but I am restrained
by the Spirit, who witnesseth to me, that if I do this, He will hold
me guilty, and I fear lest the work I have commenced should fall to
the ground.&rdquo;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
